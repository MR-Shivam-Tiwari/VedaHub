[1-1-3]\n \n *The adeptness of that person is in his knowing all the knowable aspects in this world, and he must be able to retain that knowledge to translate into his deeds, not just to sit back with his bookish knowledge, but with utmost practicality. His conduct-wise character shall be acceptable i.e., by his lineage he shall be noble, by his education he must be well-read, by his actions they must be conducive to norms laid down in Veda-s, and thus given any area, he should conduct himself properly. And he must be benign not only to higher-ups but to lowly subjects, like Guha, Shabari et al., and he should deal with wrongdoers and right-doers conscientiously. Further, he in his mien he shall be pleasant, but not an unsightly one. The word eka also means 'unique' and thus his complexion, facial, physical structures etc., shall be unique and shall differ from ordinary beings. kShaNe kShaNe yat navataam upaiti tadeva ruupam ramaNiiyataayaaH which * what * who gets newness moment by moment, that alone is pleasant...*\n  'आत्मवान् को जितक्रोधो द्युतिमान् कोऽनसूयकः | कस्य बिभ्यति देवाश्च जातरोषस्य संयुगे || १-१-४'\n `4. aatmavaan = self-composed; kaH = who is; jitakrodhaH = one with controlled ire; dyutimaan = brilliant one; anasuuyakaH = not jealous; kaH = who is; jaataroSasya = with anger born; kasya = of whom; saMyuge = in war; devaaH ca = gods even; bibhyati = are afraid.` Who is that self-composed one, who controlled his ire, who is brilliant, non-jealous and whom do even the gods fear, when provoked to war... [1-1-4]\n \n  'एतदिच्छाम्यहं श्रोतुं परं कौतूहलं हि मे | महर्षे त्वं समर्थोऽसि ज्ञातुमेवंविधं नरम् || १-१-५'\n `5. etat aham shrotum icChaami = all this I wish to listen; me kautuuhalam param hi = my inquisitiveness is immense indeed; maharShe= Oh! Great Sage - Narada; tvam = you; samarthaH asi = are competent; j~naatum = to know; evamvidham naram = [about] this kind of man.` All this I wish to listen from you, oh! Great Sage, you are competent to know this kind of man, and indeed my inquisitiveness is immense... Thus Valmiki enquired with Narada. [1-1-5]\n \n *Valmiki wanted to know about that man - a man with godly qualities. Valmiki is thinking aloud, about the qualities of his prospective hero of this epic and these are the very opening questions put to an Omniscient Sage Narada. Both the sages know of Rama and his deeds. Even then Valmiki asks Narada, who is that man with godly qualities? If Narada tells that Rama is Vishnu Himself, there is nothing left for Valmiki to compose his epic, because there are numerous mythologies, puraaNa-s, that have already adored God Vishnu. If Narada tells that Rama is so-and-so king, again Valmiki need not attempt to author about some king, however great that king might be.\n The attributes of the hero of Ramayana, as required by Valmiki, are 16; sixteen in number.1 - guNavaan 2 - viryavaan 3 - dharmaj~naH 4 - kRitaj~naH 5 - satyavaakyaH 6 - dhRiDhavrataH 7 - caaritravaan 8 - sarvabhuuteShu hitaH 9 - vidvaan 1 O - samarthaH - 11 - priyadarshanaH 12 - aatmavaan 13 - jitakrodhaH 14 - dyutimaan 15 - anasuuyakaH 16 - bibhyatidevaaH These sixteen attributes are attributed to the sixteen phases of the Full Moon, and Valmiki is about to picture Rama to be as pleasant as a full-moon.*\n  'श्रुत्वा चैतत्त्रिलोकज्ञो वाल्मीकेर्नारदो वचः | श्रूयतामिति चामन्त्र्य प्रहृष्टो वाक्यमब्रवीत् || १-१-६'\n `6. trilokaj~naH = familiar with the three worlds; naaradaH = Narada; etat vachaH shrutvaa = on listening to all those words; vaalmiikeH = of Valmiki; shruuyataam = let it be heard; iti = thus; aamantrya cha = beckoning [Valmiki,] also; prahRiSTaH = being delighted; vaakyam abraviit = spoke (these) words.` On listening all those words of Valmiki, Narada, the knower of all the three worlds, said let it be heard... and beckoning at Sage Valmiki to listen attentively, he spoke these words very gladly. [1-1-6]\n \n *Narada is cognizant of three worlds, where the three worlds are bhuuloka, bhuvarloka, suvarloka this world, the intermediary heaven, the heavens themselves.*\n  'बहवो दुर्लभाश्चैव ये त्वया कीर्तिता गुणाः | मुने वक्ष्याम्यहं बुद्ध्वा तैर्युक्तः श्रूयतां नरः || १-१-७'\n `7. mune = oh sage Valmiki; bahavaH = many; ca durlabhaaH = and unattainable; eva = indeed; ye guNaaH = whichever merits; tvayaa kiirtitaaH = extolled by you; naraH = man; taiH yuktaH = who has these merits; aham buddhvaa = I, after knowing; vakShyaami = I will speak; shruuyataam = Let it be heard.` Oh! Sage Valmiki, the merits which you have extolled are many, and unattainable. I, after having known from Brahma of such a man with all these merits, will speak on...Let it be heard. Thus Narada started to say. [1-1-7]\n \n *Narada came hither to impart the legend of Rama, as Brahma already imparted the same to him, and wanted him to impart these very attributes to Valmiki to compose Ramayana. It is a coincidence of interests Valmiki and those of Narada and Brahma.*\n  'इक्ष्वाकुवंशप्रभवो रामो नाम जनैः श्रुतः | नियतात्मा महावीर्यो द्युतिमान् धृतिमान् वशी || १-१-८'\n `8. ikshvaakuvamshaprabhavaH = Born in Ikshvaku dynasty; raamaH naama = One named Rama; janaiH shrutaH = has been heard by people; niyataatmaa = with a controlled self; mahaaviiryaH = highly valorous one; dyutimaan = resplendent one; dhRithimaan = steadfast; vashii = controller [of vice and vile [or,] senses.]` One emerged from Ikshvaku dynasty, known to people as Rama by name. He is with a controlled self, highly valorous, resplendent, steadfast and a controller of (vice and vile... or) his own senses. [1-1-8]\n \n *For the attributes explained by Narada there are some Vedanta imports. From niyataatmaa to vashii these are the attributes of the Supreme Being, Absolute of Brahman. swaruupa-niruupaka- lakShaNaaH . This niyataatmaa is immutable Absolute, this is the postulate of any Upanishad: ya aatmaa apahatapaapmaa virajo vimRityurvishoko... 8-7-1, Chāndogya-UpaniShad. mahaaviiryaH = acintya vividhavicitrashaktivaan Absolute is Omnicompetent paraa asya shaktiH vividhaa iva shruuyate svaabhaavikii j~naanabalakriyaa ca 6-8, Shwetaashvatara-UpaniShad. The word dyutimaan is for the attribute of Self-Resplendent Absolute, or, Resplendence of Consciousness. tam eva bhaantam anubhaati sarvam tasya bhaasaa sarvam idam bhaati 2-11, Mundaka-UpaniShad. And the dhRithimaan is Sublime Bliss, according to Vyjayanti dhRitiH tu tuSTiH santoSaH and as said in aanando brahma - aanandaat eva khalu imaani bhuutaani jaayante 6, Taittariiya- Upanishad. Next, vashii Absolute is the Omnipotent on the entire Universe. eko vahii sarva bhuutaantaraatmaa 2-5-12, Katha-Upanishad and sarvasya vashii sarvasya iishaanaH and the like. The rest of the attributes of Rama as said by Narada are identifiable with the causative factors of that Absolute in Creation, and the process of Creation is the self-expression of the Absolute.*\n  'बुद्धिमान्नीतिमान्वाग्ग्मी श्रीमान् शत्रुनिबर्हणः | विपुलांसो महाबाहुः कम्बुग्रीवो महाहनुः || १-१-९'\n `9. buddhimaan = wise; niitimaan = moralist; vaagmii = eloquent; shriimaan = glorious one; shatrunibharhaNaH = destroyer of enemies; vipulaamsaH = broad shouldered; mahaabaahuH = with lengthy arms; kambugriivaH = with three lines in the neck [indicative of good fortune]; mahaahanuH = high cheek bones.` He is a wise one, moralist, eloquent, glorious, and a destroyer of enemies. His arms are lengthy, with three lines in the neck [indicative of good fortune], and cheekbones high... [1-1-9]\n \n *The Absolute is an adept one in creating the Creation yat sarvaj~naH sarvavit. He is niitimaan one who maintains the rhythm of universe as said at eSa setuH vidharaNa eSaam lokanaamasambhedaaya... He is propitious because shriiH kaantisaMpadoH lakshmyaam... gleaming, glistering richness of prosperity emanates from him. The following stanzas describe the physical qualities an Emperor should have by birth, as per saamudrikashaastra, the physiognomic treatise of astrology.*\n  'महोरस्को महेष्वासो गूढजत्रुररिन्दमः | आजानुबाहुः सुशिराः सुललाटः सुविक्रमः || १-१-१०'\n `1 O . mahoraskaH = broad chested; maheShvaasaH = [one who handles] long bow; guuDhajatruH = with concealed collarbones [thick shouldered]; arindamaH = enemy subjugator; aajaanubaahuH = with long arms; sushiraaH = with a high [crowning] head; sulalaaTaH = with ample forehead; suvikramaH = with a good gait.` He is lion-chested, with concealed collarbones, knee-length are his arms, and his is a long bow, an enemy-subjugator, and his emperors countenance is with a crowning-head and an ample forehead, and his gait is majestic like that of a lion... [1-1-1 O ]\n \n *When his physique is extolled, suddenly a weapon is said, in saying that 'his is longbow...' this is called prakramabhangadoSa 'jump-cut in narration...' It is not so, his lengthy arms are said firstly and those arms can wield a great bow that can eliminate enemies, both physical and psychological ones like ariSaDvarga like desire, ire, avarice, conceit etc., as detailed in verse 4 above.*\n  'समः समविभक्ताङ्गः स्निग्धवर्णः प्रतापवान् | पीनवक्षा विशालाक्षो लक्ष्मीवान् शुभलक्षणः || १-१-११'\n `11. samaH = Built in right proportion (physically); samavibhaktaaNgaH = with symmetrically divided limbs; snigdhavarNaH = charmingly coloured [complexioned]; prataapavaan = courageous one [or, resplendent one]; piinavakShaaH = sinew chested; vishaalaakShaH = wide eyed; lakShmiivaan = prosperous one; shubhalakShaNaH = with auspicious features.` He is built proportionately physically, with limbs poised symmetrically, sinew-chested, wide-eyed, complexioned charmingly... he is a prosperous one with all the auspicious features ... [1-1-11]\n \n *Up to here the godly physical aspect bhagavadvigraha is explained that which is perceptible by the adherents as said in Chāndogya Upanishad: ya eSo antaraaditye hiraNmayaH puruSo dRishyate... 1-6-6. From now on, the features that are reliable for the adherers are said.*\n  'धर्मज्ञः सत्यसन्धश्च प्रजानां च हिते रतः | यशस्वी ज्ञानसंपन्नः शुचिर्वश्यः समाधिमान् || १-१-१२'\n `12. dharmaj~naH = rectitude knower; satyasandhaH ca = truth-bidden also; prajaanaam ca hite rataH = also concerned in welfare of subjects; yashasvii = famed one; j~naanasaMpannaH = with proficient prudence; shuchiH = clean [in conduct]; vashyaH = self-controlled; samaadhimaan = attentive one.` He is the knower of rectitude, bidden by the truth, also his concern is in the welfare of subjects, proficient in prudence, clean in his conduct, self-controlled and an attentive one... [1-1-12]\n \n  'प्रजापतिसमः श्रीमान् धाता रिपुनिषूदनः | रक्षिता जीवलोकस्य धर्मस्य परिरक्षिता|| १-१-१३'\n `13. prajaapatisamaH = equals the Lord of creatures; dhaataa = Sustainer (Lord Vishnu); shriimaan = (together) with Sri Lakshmi ; ripuniShuudanaH = Eliminator of enemies; jiivalokasya rakShitaa = Protector of the world of living creatures; dharmasya parirakShitaa = complete Guardian of probity.` He equals Lord Vishnu, the Lord of all creatures, Sustainer of the Universe, together with Sri Lakshmi (shriimaan = lakShmiivaan), Eliminator of enemies, Protector of the world of living creatures and complete Guardian of probity... [1-1-13]\n \n *The word रक्षिता is the Nominative Singular of रक्षितृ and means Protector. Please note that prajaapatiH can be applied to Vedic Gods as well as to Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu and Lord Maheswara. Here we consider Rama as equalling the Supreme God Lord Vishnu who is the One with Goddess Sri Lakshmi and also the sustainer. prajaapatiH is thus being translated as Lord Vishnu. Please note that we are deviating from traditional translations of prajaapatiH as Lord Brahma here and this is intentional.\n These features show the aspects of Ramas incarnation... Govindaraja. These features are available only in the Supreme Person, but unobtainable in any other... Maheshvara Tiirtha. These two, Govindaraja and Maheshvara Tiirtha are reputed commentators on Ramayana among many others.*\n  'रक्षिता स्वस्य धर्मस्य स्वजनस्य च रक्षिता | वेदवेदाङ्गतत्त्वज्ञो धनुर्वेदे च निष्ठितः || १-१-१४'\n `14. svasya dharmasya rakShitaa = preserver of his own righteousness; svajanasya ca rakShitaa = champion of his own people also; vedavedaaNgatattvaj~naH = scholar in essence (of) Veda-s and ancillaries; niSTitaH = an expert; dhanurvede ca = in the science of archery.` He is the preserver of his own righteousness and also a champion for adherents welfare in the same righteousness, and he is a scholar in the essence of Veda-s and their ancillaries, too. He is an expert in dhanurVeda, the Art of Archery... [1-1-14]\n \n *These are the ancillary subjects of Vedas called anga part and upa-anga sub-part. The main parts of Veda-s are shikShaa ritual rigor vyaakaraNa grammar chandas prosody jyotishya astrology nirukta recital rules kalpa procedure rules. This apart, the dhanurveda science of archery, itself is treated as an exclusive Veda taught to warriors... The dhanurveda is not to be construed as simple bow and arrow and 'shooting the target' education. It is a 'scripture on missiles' that existed in those ages.\n Down the memory lane, O. A.Vijayan, the eminent Indian journalist has reflected in The Illustrated Weekly of India, that the Soviet scholar Dr. A. A. Gorbovsky said in his article with heading Ancient India may have had N-arms , in the Statesman, with dateline Moscow, Sept. 8, 1986. Among other things, the scientist observes by the stanzas that describe the disaster caused by such astra-s, now loosely termed as a well crafted bow and sky rocketing arrows, as below:\n A blazing shaft which possessed all the effulgence of smokeless fire was let off... all directions were enveloped by darkness... the very elements seemed to be perturbed... the sun seemed to turn... the universe, scorched with heat, seemed to be in fever... the survivors lost their hair and nails... for years the sun and sky remained shrouded with clouds...\n Thus the narration goes on. This is the account of Brahmaastra, as in Mahabharata, the other Epic of India. Thus the Dhanurveda may be taken as the canon of missile sciences, which fortunately has not been handed over to the successive generations, lest everything would have been annihilated by now. In Ramayana too, which is much earlier to Mahabharata, there are elaborate accounts of such astra-s in the coming chapters. Sage Vishvamitra, who is well-versed in warfare, gives many such weapons to Rama. For now, these bow and arrow references may not be taken as those of Robin Hood.*\n  'सर्वशास्त्रार्थतत्त्वज्ञः स्मृतिमान् प्रतिभानवान् | सर्वलोकप्रियः साधुरदीनात्मा विचक्षणः || १-१-१५'\n `15. sarvashaastraarthatattvaj~naH = cognizant of the essence and meaning of all the scriptures; smRitimaan = one with excellent memory; pratibhaanavaan = a brilliant one;sarvalokapriyaH = dear to all worlds; saadhuH = gentle; adiinaatmaa = undepressed in spirit [level-headed even in severe trouble]; vichakSaNaH = clear-headed [in discriminating and distinguishing.]` He is the knower of the meaning and essence of all the scriptures, excellent at memory, a brilliant one, and dear to all the worlds, gentle, level-headed and clear-headed in discriminating and distinguishing... [1-1-15]\n \n  'सर्वदाभिगतः सद्भिः समुद्र इव सिन्धुभिः | आर्यः सर्वसमश्चैव सदैव प्रियदर्शनः || १-१-१६'\n `16. samudraH sindhubhiH iva = like an ocean by rivers; sarvadaa abhigataH = always accessible; sadbhiH = by clean-minded ones; aaryaH = noble one; sarvasamaH ca eva = and also treats all equally; sadaa eva priyadarshanaH = indeed ever a feast to the eye.` Like an ocean that is reached by rivers, that reverential one too is always accessible and reachable by clean-minded ones, and he treats all equally, and ever a feast to eye... [1-1-16]\n \n *Here it is said he is reachable by all clean-minded ones... satpravartana, sadbudhhi... and those that approach him with a sacrilegious intent, will meet their end at his hand. sarvasamaH means, that he does not discriminate people by their caste, creed, or by that individuals philosophy etc., like tribal boatman Guha, low-birthed Shabari, and nihilist Sage Jaabaali et al. jaati-guNa- vRitti-aadi bhedaabhaavaat And the word eva in sa eva priyadarshanaH indicates 'always...' unvarying in his demeanour with anyone... Govindaraja. And by the simile of ocean to Rama, for rivers there is no other course except an ocean; thus, the living beings, may it be humans or birds like Jataayu, have no other recourse than Rama.*\n  'स च सर्वगुणोपेतः कौसल्यानन्दवर्धनः | समुद्र इव गाम्भीर्ये धैर्येण हिमवानिव || १-१-१७'\n `17. kausalyaanandavardhanaH = One who betters Kausalyas [his mothers] happiness; saH ca = he (is) also; sarvaguNopetaH = embodied with all [noble] merits; gaambhiirye samudraH iva = like an ocean in profundity - his inmost heart is unfathomable like an ocean; dhairyeNa himavaan iva = by fortitude Himavanta [Himalayan] mountain like.` He who betters the happiness of his mother Kausalya is an embodiment of all noble merits, and in profundity he is like an unfathomable ocean, and by fortitude he is unalterable like the kingly Himalayan mountain... [1-1-17]\n \n *At times Rama is said to be the son of Kausalya... than the son of Dasharatha, because the word Kausalya does not signify his mother alone, the daughter of King of Kosala, but it has meanings like kShema, kushala, saamarthya, puNya, nipuNatva safeness, soundness, capability, merit, expertise... and this also signifies Queen Kausalyas worshipping of Vishnu. When dynasty, valour, braveness etc., are said, Ramas name will be attached with Dasharatha. An ocean is not a bottomless one but an unfathomable one. So also Ramas heart has a reachable bottom, where pearls, gems, and other treasures of virtues are abounding, and it can be reached with a heartily approach. For a hard-hearted one, Ramas heart becomes an unfathomable abyss and he will get lost in it. girayoH varShadhaaraabhirharyamaaNaa na vivyadhuH | abhibhuuyamaanaa vyasanaiH yathaa adhokShajacetasaa || true devotees do not get hassled though subjected to many problems, for they place their faith in the Supreme. Equally, mountains are unshaken though battered by storms or lightings... So, like a mountain he is unalterable and constant for a true devotee. An icy-mountain is meltable by scorching sun, thus Rama also melts down when his adherents are scorched with their problems.*\n  'विष्णुना सदृशो वीर्ये सोमवत्प्रियदर्शनः | कालाग्निसदृशः क्रोधे क्षमया पृथिवीसमः || १-१-१८ धनदेन समस्त्यागे सत्ये धर्म इवापरः |'\n `18, 19a. viirye = in valour; vishNunaa sadRishaH = comparable to Vishnu; somavat priyadarshanaH = attractive in look like the moon; krodhe = in anger; kaalaagnisadRishaH = matchable to the world ending fire; kShamayaa pRithiviisamaH = equals to the Earth in forgiveness; tyage = in benevolence; dhanadena samaH = equal to Kubera [God of Wealth]; satye = in candour; aparaH = with no rival; dharmaH iva = like Truth personified.` In valour Rama is comparable to Vishnu, and in his looks he is attractive like the moon, he equals the earth in his forgiveness, but he is matchable to world ending fire in his wrath... and in benevolence he is identical to Kubera, God of Wealth, and in his candour he is like Dharma itself, the Truth personified, with none to rival him... [1-1-18, 19a]\n \n *Here the 'valour' is to cause harm to enemy, while remaining himself unharmed... svasya avikaara eva parasya vikaara aapadanam Rama Tilaka. Though Rama is Vishnu, but by nature of his incarnation as human, he is different from Vishnu upaadhi-bheda... Hence Vishnu has become another entity than Rama... Or, his valour is selfsame to Vishnus valour because he is selfsame Vishnu... Govindaraja. As there is none other in similitude, he is compared Vishnu, insofar as valour is concerned... Maheshvara Tiirtha. Earth personally does not grieve when people tread on it, trample, dig, cut, or whatever is done to her. Likewise Rama personally gets unaffected, whatever harm is done to him, but he becomes wrathful, if that harm is committed to dharma.\n Thitherto, the BalaKanda is narrated by these narrations of sparkled in Ikshvaku dynasty Ramas incarnation... highly valorous, enemy subjugator... elimination of demoness Tataka, subdual of the vanity of Parashu Rama... propitious marriage with Seetha, knows Art of Archery receiving missiles from Vishvamitra... From now poet tells the Ayodhya Kanda, and a gist of this magnum opus is given here itself. This narration is known as baala raamayana - saMkShepa raamaayaNa meaning that it is aimed at youngsters as it has been told in an abridged version. In the endnote, details about this version and still abridged version, called Gayatri Ramayana, are given.\n Readers may find an inordinate use of ellipses in translation of the epic. But they are 'a must.' Pt. Satya Vrat, the author of Ramayana - A Linguistic Study says: Ellipsis is the peculiarity of the style of the older works like Ramayana... their writings, as they stood, yielded incomplete sense which has to be supplemented by adhyaahaara, viz., supply of words, that would fit in the context... Indeed, in most cases the ellipsis could be readily understood and would suggest the word or words that would make it up... We therefore request the readers to go by the meaning of the context, than by the order of words, for there is a saying... paaThakrame arthakramo baliiyaH... So, this adhyaahaara, supply of words, may not be that faithful while rendering from Sanskrit to English.*\n  'तमेवं गुणसम्पन्नं रामं सत्यपराक्रमम् || १-१-१९ ज्येष्ठं श्रेष्ठगुणैर्युक्तं प्रियं दशरथस्सुतम् | \n प्रकृतीनां हितैर्युक्तं प्रकृतिप्रियकाम्यया || १-१-२० यौवराज्येन संयोक्तुमैच्छत् प्रीत्या महीपतिः |' \n `19b, 2 O , 21a. mahiipatiH dasharathaH = Lord of the land King Dasaratha; prakRitipriyakaamyayaa = with an intent for doing good to the people; priityaa = affectionately; aicChat = desired; saMyoktum = to endow with; yauvaraajyena = regent-hood; tam raamam = to that Rama; jyeSTham sutam = the eldest son; priyam = a dear one [to Dasaratha]; evaM guNasaMpannam = [who was] possessor of such like merits; satyaparaakramam = with true valour; shreSTa-guNaiH-yuktam = together with best of qualities; prakRitiinaam hitaiH yuktam = concerned for welfare of the people.` Lord of the land King Dasaratha with an intent for doing good to the people, affectionately desired to endow with regent-hood to that Rama, the eldest and a dear son to Dasaratha and who possessed such merits with true valour, together with best of qualities, and concerned for welfare of the people....[1-1-29b, 2 O , 21a]\n \n  'तस्याभिषेकसंभारान् दृष्ट्वा भार्याथ कैकयी || १-१-२१ पुर्वं दत्तवरा देवी वरमेनमयाचत | विवासनं च रामस्य भरतस्याभिषेचनम् || १-१-२२'\n `21b, 22. atha = then; dRiShTvaa = seeing; tasya = his - Ramas; abhiShekasaMbhaaraan = anointment [as crown prince] arrangements; bhaarya devii kaikeyi = (Dasarathas) [dear] wife queen Kaikeyi; puurvam dattavaraa = having been with previously given boons; ayaachata = solicited; raamasya vivaasanam = Ramas, exile; bharatasya abhiSechanam ca = and Bharatas, anointment; varam enam = (as) boons from him [Dasaratha].` Then seeing the arrangements for the anointment of Rama as crown-prince, Kaikeyi, the dear wife and a queen of Dasaratha, solicited boons that were once accorded to her by Dasharatha, for the banishment of Rama and anointment of Bharata as boons.

Next is the form of Tilottama, a divine beauty to hoodwink demons called Sunda and Upasunda. The other is Vishnus liilaa shakti, which is divinely fascinating. Yet another is grammatical connotation, maa yaa where, maa= Goddess Lakshmi; yaa= who that is; meaning yaa siitaa saa maa= who is Goddess Lakshmi... She is Seetha... and this results in the saying: ati ruupavatii siitaa... ati muurkhaH cha raavaNa While Seetha is extraordinarily beautiful, Ravana is exceedingly stupid...\n The deities have their wives always with them.

[1-1-59b, 6 O a]\n \n *Here the use of 'highly powerful...' for Rama is to indicate that though he himself was capable enough to eliminate Ravana, but as a human, he needed some agency, since humans in such difficulties are usually in need of a helping hand. As such, Rama had to befriend Sugreeva and it was necessary to narrate all sad episodes to his friend.*\n  'सुग्रीवश्चापि तत्सर्वं श्रुत्वा रामस्य वानरः || १-१-६० चकार सख्यं रामेण प्रीतश्चैवाग्निसाक्षिकम् |'\n `6 O b, 61a. vaanaraH sugriivaH ca api = The Vanara Sugreeva also; tat sarvam shrutvaa = after listening to all that [talk]; raamasya = of Rama; sakhyam chakaara = made friendship [with Rama]; priitaH = delighted; agnisaakShikam ca eva = with fire [flaring auspicious fire] as witness also thus.` The Vanara Sugreeva after listening to all that talk of Rama made friendship with Rama delightedly with sacred fire as witness...

In that regard Vanara Sugreeva also described Valis strength... [1-1-62b, 63a]\n \n * Vali, the elder brother of Sugreeva, is another principle character of Ramayana. He is capable of rendering oblations to gods in the wee hours of a single day in four oceans on four sides of the globe, by his flying from one ocean to the other. He is mightier than Ravana, the chief villain of the epic, and Ravana was subdued by Valis strength. As a preamble to the incident of eliminating mighty Ravana in the last book of the epic, this episode of eliminating a still mightier monkey is the stepping-stone for the climactic victory.*\n  'सुग्रीवः शङ्कितश्चासीन्नित्यं वीर्येण राघवे || १-१-६३ राघवप्रत्ययार्थं तु दुन्दुभेः कायमुत्तमम् | दर्शयामास सुग्रीवो महापर्वतसन्निभम् || १-१-६४'\n `63b, 64. tu = But; sugriivaH = Sugreeva; nityam shankitaH aasiit = remained ever doubtful; raaghave = with respect to Raghava; viiryeNa = about [Ramas] prowess; sugriivaH = Sugreeva; darshayaamaasa = showed; dundubheH = Dundubhis; uttamam = big ; mahaaparvatasannibham = great mountain like; kaayam = body; raaghavapratyayaartham = to gain confidence in Raghava.` But Sugreeva remained ever doubtful with respect to Raghava, about Raghavas prowess. Sugreeva showed Dundubhis big and great mountain-like dead body to gain confidence in Raghava... [1-1-63b, 64]\n \n *Vali had at one time killed Dundubhi and kicked his body over a long distance.* \n  'उत्स्मयित्वा महाबाहुः प्रेक्ष्य चास्थि महाबलः | पादाङ्गुष्ठेन चिक्षेप सम्पूर्णं दशयोजनम् || १-१-६५'\n `65. mahaabaahuH = Great armed; mahaabalaH = [and] very powerful [Rama]; prekShya = after seeing; asthi = the bone; utsmayitvaa = smiling ; ca paadaanguSThena [anguSTa-agreNa] = and by the big toe of his foot; chikShepa = threw [it];sampuurNam dashayojanam = wholly for ten yojana-s length.` Great armed and very powerful Rama after seeing the bones of Dundubhi smiled and by the big toe of his foot threw it wholly for ten yojana-s length. [1-1-65]\n \n *Vali was able to throw that body, with whole of his foot, only up to two hundred bow-lengths, where the length of bow is said as six to seven feet. But Rama could kick that heap to ten yojana lengths, roughly ninety miles, only with a flip of his foot-toes tip. But Sugreeva continued his grumbling, in those days this skeleton was with flesh and blood, now it became weight-less, thus show me more of your show of strength... One Yojana is an ancient measure for distance, where that distance is covered in one yoking. Chambers dictionary puts it as five miles, and it is not agreeable for it was British-Indian revenue measure. Traditionally it is four krosha-s and thus each yojana is nine to ten miles.\n Govindaraja cleaves the compound utsmayitvaa to ut smayitvaa and takes ut 'to up...' and fixes it to cikShepa to mean ut cikShepa up-heaved and hurled... and smayitva comes to mean smiling self-assuredly, or smiling self-composedly... And Maheshvara Tiirtha says that when all-wise-knowers are not able to know what I am, there is no surprise if a monkey in a remote forest doubts my capability... let him see a speck of it... thus Rama smiled in aplomb...\n And the often repeated epithet to Rama mahaabaahuH means not just yards and yards of lengthy arms...dangling up to knees.. but  one who does unimaginable deeds... and his arms are the unusual instruments to perform such unusual tasks, hence ambidextrous, or omni-dextrous... *\n  'बिभेद च पुनः सालान् सप्तैकेन महेषुणा | गिरिं रसातलं चैव जनयन् प्रत्ययं तदा || १-१-६६'\n `66. tadaa = Then; punaH = again; ekena maheShuNaa = with one great arrow; bibheda = [Rama] ripped [through]; saptasaalaan = seven sala trees; girim ca = and a mountain; rasaatalam ca eva = and subterranean earth; pratyayam janayan = to create faith [in the mind of Sugreeva]` Then again Rama ripped through seven massive Sala trees with only one great arrow, which not only went through the trees but also rent through a mountain, and to the nethermost subterranean of earth, in order to create faith in the mind of Sugreeva...

Hindus have four such puruSaartha -s [namely human values,] dharma probity artha prosperity, kaama pleasures, and finally mokSha , blessedness. Of these four only the first three, dharma, artha, kaama are usually referred, and they are called tri-varga . The final one mokSha is not often quoted. Dhrama is the driving force. chodanaa lakShaNaartho dharmaH - Jaimini. Hence dharma is the prescribed conduct, either by scriptures or by the society, and it does not entail any merit or demerit, but just an obligatory conduct or duty or, say categorical imperative of Kant. And the other two, artha, kaama , are the means of dharma, and all leading to moksha. These two great epics Ramayana and Mahabharata are structured on these puruSaartha -s alone. Thus though Ramayana is abounding with the accounts of richness and glory of all kinds of wealth, which is secondary to human values, its main import is the virtuosity of human living. The ocean, though abounding with other less valuable items like conch shells, mother-of-pearl shells etc., its gems beneath all these peripherals are of high value. Thus this is an ear pleasing by its musical melody and heart pleasing by its meaningful wording. Further, it is pleasant for its import is in accordance with all the scriptures.*\n  'स यथा कथितं पुर्वं नारदेन महात्मना | रघुवंशस्य चरितं चकार भगवान्मुनिः || १-३-९'\n `9. bhagavaan saH muniH = he that godly saint [Valmiki]; mahaatmanaa naaradena = by Divine Soul, Narada; puurvam yathaa kathitam = earlier, as to how, narrated; [in that way only]; raghuvamshasya = one who is born in Raghus lineage - of Rama; charitam chakaara = legend, made [composed].` That godly saint Valmiki composed the legend of Rama, the legatee of Raghu, exactly as the divine-soul Narada narrated it earlier.

[1-4-2]\n \n *The twenty-four are the letters in Gayatri hymn. Ramayanas scheming is based on Gayatri hymn and for this: atra caturvi~Nshatisa~Nkhyo uktyaa caturvi~NshatyakSharagaayatrii tulyataa suucitaa | prathamaadhyaaye - tapaHsvaadhyaaya - ityatra prathamam takaarasya - sargaante - mahatvamiiyaat -- ityatra yaat - iti akSharasya grahaNaat api gaayatriiruupatvam suucitam - dharmaakuutam\n There is a controversy about the number of verses and cantos. If Uttara Ramayana, otherwise called abhudaya-kaanDa, is ascribed to Valmiki, the cantos are seven and chapters are about 649 and verses are about 24,253. But some verses and chapters are deleted for standardization of Ramayana as per this verse and they contain 56 O chapters and 24, O O verses only. Some argue that when it is said 24, O O O verses are there, it does not actually a mathematical assertion, like the calculation of mahaayuga -s and manvantara -s, and as one would give a reply to his age as 3 O years, or 6 O years, but not as 29 years, 6 months, seven days or so... In furthering that standardization affair, some said that even this canto, Bala kaanda is not authored by Valmiki. It is not clear as of now when the pundits can decide as to which is standard and which is not.\n The transcendental aspect of Ramayana and its content is explained in 18 terms by ancient commentator Govindaraja. 1] Ramas Absoluteness, paramaatmatattva ; 2] Ideation to know Him, upaaya ; 3] Dedication in Him, kainkarya ; 4] Human aspect, puruSaakaara ; 5] Diviner, adhikaara ; 6] Resolve in God, adhikaarapaaratantrya ; 7] Gods resolve in Dedicate, bhagavatpaaratantrya ; 8] Knowledge of five Meanings, arthapancakaj~naana ; 9] Self-denial, akincanatvam ; 1 O ] Teacher selecting, aacaaryavaraNam ; 11] Climax, autkaNThataa ; 12] Behaviour, pravartanaa ; 13] Residence, vaasasthaana ; 14] Two Narayana hymns, naaraayaNamantradvaya ; 15] Gayatri, Gayatri hymn; 16] Negating negative-thinking, durvicaaraparihaara ; 17] negating Love for Living, samsaarajihaasa ; 18] 64 Divinely Arts, catuHSaSTi-kalaamayatva . Of them we take up the 15th Gayatri.\n The identification of Gayatri with Ramayana scheme is explained in many ways. By tat savitRi the features and attributes of the Absolute as per narrations in BalaKanda. vareNya by the narration of Absolutes attributes in Ayodhya and Kishkindha kaanda-s, and adherents like Lakshmana, Bharata, Sugreeva take shelter in Him here only. bharga is identified as per the description of resplendence of The Divine as envisaged by the sages and hermits in Aranya Kanda. devasya and in dhiimahi where that deva the Divine is explained by Hanuma, not only to Seetha but to all in Sundara kanda. hi dhii mahi is as explained in Uttara Kanda, which centers around mokSha salvation.*\n 'कृत्वापि तन्महाप्राज्ञः सभविष्यं सहोत्तरम् | चिन्तयामास कोन्वेतत्प्रयुञ्जीयादिति प्रभुः ||१-४-३'\n `3. mahapraaj~naH prabhuH = great scholar, godly-saint Valmiki; sabhaviShyam saha uttaram = with leading, with sequel; tat = that Ramayana; kRitvaa tu = having composed, but; kaH = who; nu = really; etat = all this; prayu~njiiyaat iti = well render, thus; chintayaamaasa = thought over.` Though that great scholar composed thus with leading and sequel legends, that godly saint thought over thus really, who will render all this ballad...

Giving one to many names to poem epics is usual as in maaghakaavya which is known as shishupaalavadha whereas it is actually kRiShNacarita . *\n 'पाठ्ये गेये च मधुरं प्रमाणैस्त्रिभिरन्वितम् | जातिभिः सप्तभिर्बद्धं तन्त्रीलयसमन्वितम् ||१-४-८'\n `8. paaThye geye madhuram = melodious to read and to sing; pramaaNaiH tribhiH anvitam = adaptable in three kinds scales; jaatibhiH saptabhiH baddham = orchestral sevenfold classification; tantriilayasamanvitam = string-instrument, rhythm, included.` To read or to sing it is melodious, adaptable to music with three scales and sevenfold tune, and orchestral to the tunes of string-instrument and rhythm included... [1-4-8]\n \n *The three Indian scale pauses are dRita, madhyama, vilambita . These though not equal but identical to Breve, Minim and Quaver of Western classical music. The seven fold classifications of swara-s are 1] shadja [2] madhyama [3] gaandhaara [4] niSaada [5] RiSabha [6] dhaivata [7] pa~nchama . These are roughly identical to Accelerando, Calando, Decresando, Smorzando, Sostentuo, and others of Western classical music.*\n 'रसैः शृंगारकरुणहास्यरौद्रभयानकैः | वीरादिभी रसैर्युक्तं काव्यमेतदगायताम् ||१-४-९'\n `9. rasaiH sRingaarakaruNahaasyaraudrabhayaanakaiH = aesthetics, romance, pathos, comic, fury, fright, and others; viiraadibhiH rasaiH yuktam = embodying aesthetics like valour et cetera; kaavyam agaayataam = epic, is sung.` Aesthetics like romance, pathos, comic, fury, fright, valour etc., embodying the epic is sung [by Kusha, Lava.] [1-4-9]\n \n *The Indian categorization of aesthetics rasaa -s is in nine emotions. sRingaara [romance] haasa [humour] shoka [grief] krodha [fury] utsaaha [enthusiasm, bravery] bhaya [fright] jugupsaa [disgust] vismaya [amaze.] Again sRingaara is of two kinds - a] sambhoga , [being with his*her partner,] b] vipralamba [not being with his*her partner.]\n \n Ramas togetherness with Seetha from BalaKanda till her abduction is the first category of romance. After her departure and until regain, it is second sort of romantic narration. Episodes of Surpanakha, Trijata are humorous. Those of Dasharatha, Jatayu etc., are of grievous nature. Killing, torturing etc., situations arouse furiousness. Lakshmana, Indrjit and others are showing bravery. Seeing ugly demons either in forests or those that surround Seetha is causing fright. The very sight of ugly bodied demons like Viradha, Kabandha is creating disgust. Hanumas leaping ocean, burning Lanka, and the entire Rama-Ravana war are amazing *\n .

Another kind of donation is referred here as daana-aadhyaana, meaning that these scholars while receiving donations from a righteous source, they also have to donate something to others. It is the education in Veda, which they have to impart to their students free of any charge and that too, to the befitting students only. Thus, the words, daana and pratigrahaNa mean all these rules to accept a donation or to accord it.*\n 'न नास्तिको नानृतको न कश्चिदबहुश्रुतः | नासूयको न चाशक्तो नाविद्वान्विद्यते तदा || १-६-१४'\n `14. naastikaH na = atheist, none; anRitakaH = liar; na = None; na kashchit = none, anyone; abahushrutaH = not much heard [learned]; na asuuyakaH = none, jealous; na cha = not, also; ashaktaH = disabled; na avidvaan = none, unscholarly; vidyate tadaa = is found, thus.` There is no atheist, no liar, and none is less learnt in Veda-s, and no one is found to be jealous, or disabled, or unscholarly person.

The trading class, Vaisya-s, is the follower of the Kshatriya-s, the ruling class, for the states economy is dependent on the rulership. And the fourth one, Shuudra-s, the working class, while performing its own duties, is always working for the other castes.

[1-6-22] \n *It is said that the horses born in the rivers nadii+ja are brought to the city Ayodhya. They are not water horses but horses born at the place where the historically prominent Seven Rivers of Indus Valley Rivers flow.\n Here again an account of countries is given as a glimpse. These countries Kambhoja, Bahlika, Vanayu may not be taken as the provincial countries within the present day India. Prior to the present-day peninsular India, the belt from Himalayas to Alps had a great rapport in cultural and trade exchanges without demarcations of east or west, which paved the way for Alexander, the Great, towards India.\n Sometime back, say during 1985-87, the National Geography magazine contained a beautiful article under the heading IRAQ, the crucible of civilisation , Merle Severy, as its Asst. Editor. In its carefully worded introduction, it is stated that Iraq is the traditional birthplace of man for Jews, Christians and Muslims... On the other hand, Hindus naturally believe that the Southward Himalayan region is the birthplace of man. In the same article, the regions around Euphrates and Tigris are said to be the Fertile Crescent, the cradle of Western civilization ... in the third millennium BC . Further that To the east a similar florescence occurred in the Indus and Yellow River Valleys... This florescence in Indus Valley and far eastward did not occur later to Mesopotamian or Babylonian civilisations but flourished much earlier, as per Hindu scripts and the dating of which is the eternal question like Aryan Question. However, Hindu scripts centre the present world, Bhuuloka, surrounding Meru Mountain and its geography includes the land unto Rome, Russia, China. We will refer to Meru mountain-oriented geography and its geographical account at the appropriate place. Since Ramayana dates back to Buddhism and Buddhisms westward spread is unto Afghanistan, the Kings of Ramayana must have had no problem to draft horses from Persian, Arabian or the other of Middle East countries. These countries are always famous for horse breeding, right from the days of Ramayana to Moses. Hence the accounts of horses and the countries from where they are brought may be treated as cross-continental culture. Since history believes only in the unearthed iconography and the epics or their content can not stand to the carbon-testing, the countries named here as Kambhoja, Baahlika may nearly mean Babylonian, Mesopotamian, Arabian or other unknown or unearthed historic countries of the crucible of Western civilisation, Iraq. Vanaayu, another country referred may nearly mean Roman, as Persians term Greeks as Unani in India, advent to the arrival of Alexander, the Great. We still have an herbal medication called Unani, a hybrid between Ayurveda, Greek and Persian herbal treatments. * \n 'विंध्यपर्वतजैर्मत्तैः पूर्णा हैमवतैरपि | मदान्वितैरतिबलैर्मातङ्गैः पर्वतोपमैः || १-६-२३'\n `23. vindhyaparvatajaiH = born in Vindhya mountains; mattaiH = vigorous; puurNa = full of; haimavataiH api = Himalayan born, also; madaanvitaiH = fully fattened; atibalaiH = most mighty; maatangaiH = elephants; parvatopamaiH = mountain in similitude.` Born in Vindhya Mountains, and also from Himalayan regions, mighty are the elephants fully vigorous and fattened ones, and most powerful in their strength and each in similitude is a huge mountain.

And these eight elephants have their presiding deities. From those eight elephants, four are prominent. They are Airaavata , the Elephant of Indra, anjana , the Elephant of varuNa , the Rain-god, vaamana , the Elephant of Yama, the Lord of Death, and another is punDariika . Thus, the elephants of Ayodhya are termed as divine breed.*\n 'भद्रैर्मन्द्रैर्मृगैश्चैव भद्रमन्द्रमृगैस्तथा | भद्रमन्द्रैर्भद्रमृगैर्मृगमन्द्रैश्च सा पुरी | नित्यमत्तैः सदा पूर्णा नागैरचलसन्निभैः || १-६-२५'\n `25-26a. saa purii = that city; bhadraiH = class of Bhadra; mandraiH = class of Mandra; mRigaiH = class of mriga; cha eva = like that; bhadramandramRigaiH tathaa = a mixture of these three; bhadramandraiH = bhadra and mandra; bhadramRigaiH = bhadra and mriga; mRigamandraiH cha = mriga and mandra, also; nityamattaiH = always vigorous; naagaiH = elephants; achalasannibhaiH = mountain like; sadaa puurNaa = always, full with.` That city is always full with vigorous and mountain like elephants bred mainly from three classes viz., Bhadra, Mandra and Mriga. And inter-bred among these three main classes are Bhadra-Mandra, Mandra-Mriga, Bhadra-Mriga and the like. [1-6-25]\n \n *The bhadra is the elephant class for Kings ride, called bhadragaja . It is a state elephant with high honors and for occasional or ceremonial use. mandra and mRiga are classes of breed tamed and used in wars or for the ride of other nobility. These are the essential mammals used for other lifting and carrying works.*\n 'सा योजने च द्वे भूयः सत्यनामा प्रकाशते | यस्यां दशरथो राजा वसन् जगदपालयत् || १-६-२६'\n `26b-c. raajaa = king; dasharathaH naama = Dasharatha, named; yasyaam = in which [city]; vasan = while residing; jagat = world; apaalayat = ruled; saa = she that Ayodhya; bhuuyaH = further - outside also; dve yojane = two, yojana-s; satyanaamaa = true to its name; prakaashate = shines forth [well fortified.]` While residing in which city King Dasharatha ruled the world that city is further fortified up to two more yojana-s outside city, true to its name a yodhya , an un-assailable one.

The word Indra karmaNa also refers to the deeds of Dasharatha, in helping the gods forces combating the demonic forces. Thus the deeds performed by Dasharatha are like those of Indras. Here Dasharatha is bringing Sage Rishyasringa to Ayodhya. Earlier Indra led Vamana, the dwarf-boy to heavens. Vamana is the incarnation of Vishnu in early ages and after Vamana suppressed Bali, the Emperor to netherworlds, Indra took Vamana to heavens. Thus Dasharatha is like Indra on earth, both by his virtue and deed. Incidentally, Vamana i.e., Vishnu, is the son-incarnate to Sage Kaashyapa, while sage Rishyasringa is the grandson of the same Kaashyapa. Thus Sage Kaashyapa is instrumental to these two incarnations. Through the divine grace of Sage Rishyasringa, the same Vishnu is going to take birth as Rama, while Sage Kashyapa is a grandparent of Rama in this era, and while he alone was Vishnus father when Vishnu incarnated as Dwarf boy Vamana.*\n 'अन्तःपुरं प्रवेश्यैनं पूजां कृत्वा च शास्त्रतः | कृतकृत्यं तदात्मानं मेने तस्योपवाहनात् || १-११-२९'\n `29. enam = him; antaHpuram = palace-chambers; praveshya = having entered; shaastrataH = as per scriptures; puujaam cha = worshipped, too; tadaa = then; tasya = his [for Rishyasringa]; upavaahanat = by bringing here; aatmaanam = for himself; kRitakrityam = one with his desire fulfilled; mene = beleived.` Dasharatha entered the sage into the palace chambers and worshipped him there as ordained in the scriptures, and in bringing the Sage here into his country, king Dasharatha believed that his desired is fulfilled.

The whole lots of works that need be performed have the order of precedence like prime, auxiliary or adjunctive in their ordinance. A Ritwik is the elated scholar who keeps track of these activities while other scholars recite hymns as directed by these Ritwik-s. Hence, Ritwik-hood is the highest.* . *The Four Era system of Hindus\n The Four Era system, chaturyuga has the following components: satya yuga or krita yuga 17, 28, O O O years of duration.

He is the only one who once brought amrita, the Divine Elixir, for the release of his mother from slavery. Hence, the Altar of Fire is given the shape of this Divine Eagle, with its wings and tail outstretched, head turned downward, and the eyes looking eastward. yaj~na is also termed as suparNa i.e., su good, parNa winged; carrier of the oblations with his golden wings to heavens. Or its wings are glittering with gold sahasram hiraNyashakalaiH pratidinam agnim prokShati - shruti meaning every day with thousands of gold chips oblate the fire... scriptures say so.

[1-14-31]\n *Many animals are sacrificed in Horse ritual. But they will be segregated as forest animals and village animals. In them many of the forest animals will be let off by taking them round the fire on to their right in salutation to fire, agnipradakShiNa-namaskaara. The animals pertaining to village will be sacrificed in ritual. Hence it is up to the priests to decide which is to be retained or let off.*\n  'पशूनां त्रिशतं तत्र यूपेषु नियतं तदा | अश्वरत्नोत्तमं तस्य राज्ञो दशरथस्य च || १-१४-३२'\n `32. tadaa = then; tatra = in that ritual; trishatam pashuunaam = three hundred, animals; tasya raaj~naH ashwaratnottamam = that, king Dasharathas, gemlike best horse; yuupeSu niyatam = arranged [tied] to wooden posts.` Three hundred animals are tied to the ritual posts, along with the gemlike best ritual horse of that King Dasharatha.

[1-14-33]\n *Here Kausalya did not butcher the horse as queens do not butcher animals in rituals, but the horse is already sacrificed. It is a symbolical act of queens to pierce with three golden knives like needles. The scripture says that all the eligible wives of the performer of ritual have to pierce that way. sauvarNiibhi suuciibhiH patnayaH ashvasya asipathaan kalayanti - shruti / scripture. So all the three queens have performed that symbolic act by piercing that horse, which is already dead, with golden needle-like knives.

[1-14-35]\n *There will be four officiating priests for these Vedic rituals. 1. brahmaa , 2. hotaa , 3. adhvaryu , 4. udgaataa , to whom the king has to donate his inner core properties like wives, lands etc. By practice a king has to marry four wives. The four women of the king are 1. mahiSi = Queen, 2. parivRitti = neglected women, 3. vaavaata = concubine, 4. paalaakali = goblet-maid. The order of donation is that the Queen to brahmaa , concubine to hotaa , neglected woman to udgaataa , and the goblet-maid to the adhwaryu . Here, though the brahma ritvik is not cited along with paalaakali, goblet-maid, they are implied. The donation is symbolic and later bartering with some valuable items that is redeemed. Govindaraja. There is another way of translating this. For the wording, hastena samayojayan the priests took these wives by hand to bring them in contact with the dead horse.*\n  'पतत्रिणस्तस्य वपामुद्धृत्य नियतेन्द्रियः | ऋत्विक् परमसंपन्नः श्रपयामास शास्त्रतः || १-१४-३६'\n `36. udhRitya niyatendriyaH = took up, one with controlled senses; patatriNaH tasya vapaam = horses, fat [omentum]; Ritwik paramasampannaH = ritwik [priest,] very wealthy in knowledge; shrapayaamaasa shaastrataH = cooked, as per scriptures.` Then the priest, one with controlled senses and rich in scriptural wealth, took up the omentum [fat] of the horse and cooked it as per scriptures while dropping into the altar of fire to bake as a food to the celestials. [1-14-36]\n *Some more scholars give a non-violent touch to this act and they say that a medicinal plant ,is offered in altar and its smell is smelt. That plant is substituted for omentum of the horse, and the wording is read differently. When the sequence is running on horse and horses body parts how a medical plant is brought in, is unclear. And some say that a horse will not have omentum according to Vedic texts.* \n  'धूमगन्धं वपायास्तु जिघ्रति स्म नराधिपः | यथाकालं यथान्यायं निर्णुदन् पापमात्मनः || १-१४-३७'\n `37. naraadhipaH = King; yathaakaalam yathaanyaayam = as per time, as per procedure; nirNudan paapam aatmanaH = to cleanse, his own sin; dhuumagandham vapaayaaH tu = smokes smell, of fat [omentum being cooked]; jighrati sma = he was smelling.` The king Dasharatha smelt the smell of smoke as per time and procedure to cleanse his own sin.

This is compared with human body as: Item 1] to human pate with hair-locks; 2] eye - on right and nose on left [for humans have one-eyed vision of God, where God is Omniscient; 3] face; 4] neck; 5] shoulders; 6] arms; 7] leg and thigh; 8] foot. \n ‘A temple is not a home of god but it is the form of god... the temple layout is the extended form of the rhythm of the innerspace of humans, called dahara aakaasha similar to cosmos of the universe... [cf. What is a temple? What is its significance? Ganapathi Sthapati, Vaastu Vedic Research Foundation, Chennai, India.] Thus human body itself is identified with the temple, and the temple in turn with Vedic yajna shaala , and therefore it is said to keep the body clean and mind pure... which again is a Vedic import. \n The grand scale yajna-s as described in these epics like Ramayana and Maha Bharata are non-existent. But in recent times, such types of yajna-s were conducted on two occasions, once in 1975 and again in 199 O . Here are some excerpts from The Indian Express, daily newspaper, published during May 199 O : ‘Prof. Frits Staal, with financial assistance from several American funding agencies including the Smithsonian Institute and the Rockefeller Foundation, organized the agni chayana ritual in 1975. In spite of innumerable hurdles, Staal succeeded in persuading the elderly nambudri-s [scholarly priests of Vedic lore] to put together a team of ritualists old and young, give them through training, hold rehearsals for several months and finally put up performance for filming and documentation. Staal followed this up with the publication of his book called Agni ... \n Readers who are interested to know more about yajna, the Vedic ritual, may please look for the works of Prof. Frits Staal, Indologist, at whose instance such rituals were conducted in Southern India. The two-volume book of Prof. Frits Staal: AGNI: The Vedic Ritual of the Fire Altar, running over some two thousand pages. Another book is The Mantra, which is an attempt to analyse the Vedic Hymns, published by State University of New York Press, State University Plaza, Albany, N.Y., 12246, also now available with Indian Book Centre, Delhi \n According to Staal, a Vedic ritual is very different from a health cure, a psychoanalyst session, an anthropological meeting or a religious service. Staal maintains that a Vedic ritual follows its own principles and leads a life of its own. He points out that a Vedic ritual requires very detailed and specific knowledge. He estimates that the extent of specialised knowledge needed to put the sacrificial altar together ritually is on a par with the extent of technical knowledge required to build an aeroplane. ‘The bird shaped altar is in fact a kind of aeroplane…’ says Stall ‘only it takes off in a different way…’ Scientific evaluations were also made on the changes occurred on physical and metaphysical levels on the individuals who performed the ritual, by experts from Canada and in association with Prague Institute of Czechoslovakia. Kirlion photography was also undertook by Mrs. Rose Mary Steel from London to record aura or the Electro-magnetic radiation around the human organism and hundreds of pictures of not only the performers but also of the visiting people and of their finger tips are recorded. \n Usually at the end of any Vedic ritual the Hall of Ritual, a thatched shed, will be put to fire. This called puurNaahuti, complete oblation into fire. And then a rain occurs. It used to rain every time when the ritual is totally offered as an oblation into fire at the conclusion of such a ritual. ‘The association between the yajna and rain is indelible. Did it rain on [the day of puurNaahuti ] i.e., May 9, 199 O ? It did...’ The Illustrated Weekly of India, May 27, 199 O . *\n 'इति वाल्मीकिरामायणे आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे चतुर्दशः सर्गः ||'"

[1-15-4]\n *These celestial beings having attained salvation and living in their heavenly abodes do not re-enter these mortal worlds. They assemble in their cosmic zone, up above the Fire Altar of the Vedic ritual whenever a yajna is conducted on earth, to receive oblations.*\n 'ताः समेत्य यथान्यायं तस्मिन् सदसि देवताः | अब्रुवन् लोककर्तारं ब्रह्माणं वचनं ततः || १-१५-५'\n `5. taaH devataaH = those, gods; yathaanyaayam = as per procedure; tasmin sadasi = in that, congregation; sametya = coming together; lokakartaaram = to worlds creator; brahmaaNam = to Brahma; vachanam abruvan = words, said.` Those deities who procedurally assembled there in that congregation then spoke to Brahma, the creator of worlds.

Not all the raakshasa-s are evil-doers. Some of the raakshasa-s are the fallen angels who take birth as mortals. They have their Vedic education, and they perform Vedic rituals and penance etc., thereby they get the patronage of any one of the gods among the Hindu Trinity, viz., Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. On attaining the cherished boons, they suddenly revolt against their own patron deities and commence the atrocities only to conquer the Heavens, knowing well that they cannot be attained with a mortal body. In order to snub the upsurge of such violence or the unnatural ascension to Heaven, the deity who gave the boons seeks the help of any of the other two of the Trinity. Then one from the Trinity will take birth as mortal, as an incarnation of god on earth. Usually Vishnu incarnates himself to eradicate the evils created by the intrepid raakshasa-s.\n Here the celestials bring in a preamble for Vishnus incarnation as Rama and thus the topic of Ravana occurs in this chapter of Ramayana. Ravana need not be taken as an evil spirit, devil, hobgoblin or a monstrous being. He is said to be a Brahman well versed in all Vedas, musicologist, and a great king of Lanka, with unlimited riches, and very many of his clansmen with their vast dominions, and what not. Though Brahma and Shiva bless Ravana with boons, Ravana flouts all the norms in conquering Heavens in which course he did not hesitate to torture anyone who becomes his personal hurdle or hindrance. Hence it is inevitable for the Trinity to curb Ravanas atrocities, and Vishnu will now be requested by all the deities to incarnate himself on earth. As such, the expression of the word DEMON may not always be taken as an ugly and monstrous looking devil or Satan, as per the usual religious conceptualisation of evil.\n In Hinduism evil is not a separate entity from humans, but available in the same personification and resides along with virtue, like the two sides of a coin. These raakshasa-s are also mortals, extraordinary beings with extraordinary powers like god incarnates. But, with wickedness in their will, monstrosity in mind and a conquerors ambition in their heart, they are rendered themselves as demons.*\n 'उद्वेजयति लोकांस्त्रीनुच्छ्रितान् द्वेष्टि दुर्मतिः | शक्रं त्रिदशराजानं प्रधर्षयितुमिच्छति || १-१५-८'\n `8. durmatiH = that evil minded one - malevolent; triin lokaan udvejayati = he is tormenting three worlds; ucChritaan dveSTi = he is hating functionary deities of cosmos; tridasharaajaanam shakram pradharSayitum icChati = desires to assail Indra, the king of celestials.` That malevolent Ravana is tormenting all the three worlds, hating the functionary deities of cosmos, and always desires to assail Indra, the king of all the functionary deities of universe. [1-15-8]\n *There are eight functionary gods for cosmos in Hindu mythology that keep the cycle of natural law going. Each one is assigned with each of the eight sides of the universe along with a natural function. They are: 1] Indra, Heaven : East, 2] agni Fire-god : southeast, 3] yama Death-god : South, 4] naiRiti Demon-god : southwest, 5] varuNa Rain-god : west, 6] vaayu Air-god : Northwest, 7] kubera god of wealth management : North, 8] iishaana god of bliss : Northeast. The governance of all these deities is Indras function, since he is the presiding deity of Heaven.*\n 'ऋषीन् यक्षान् सगन्धर्वानसुरान् ब्राह्मणांस्तथा | अतिक्रामति दुर्धर्षो वरदानेन मोहितः || १-१५-९'\n `9. durdharShaH = invincible one; varadaanena mohitaH = becoming self-conceited by boon given [by you]; RiShiin yakShaan sagandharvaan asuraan = sages, yaksha-celestials, with gandharva-celestials, demons; tathaa braahmaNaan = like that, Brahmans are also; atikraamati = overbearingly [torturing.]` That invincible one is further self-conceited by the boons you have accorded, and he is overbearingly torturing the sages, celestial beings like yaksha-s, gandharva-s, asura-s, and like that even the Brahmans. [1-15-9]\n *The sura and a-sura nomenclature is the one that is commonly found in Vedic literature. sura is a celestial being and asura is its antonym, usually referred as a demon. Here it is not so because there are many asura-s who made their abode in heaven, like Rahu, Ketu, and others who attain salvation in this mortal life. Even Ravana came from Heaven, and returns there only at the end of the war with Rama. Thus a-sura-s are not earthly demons but celestial beings of a kind like other demi-gods, namely yaksha, gandharva, kinnara, kimpurusha etc.*\n 'नैनं सूर्यः प्रतपति पार्श्वे वाति न मारुतः | चलोर्मिमाली तं दृष्ट्वा समुद्रोऽपि न कंपते || १-१५-१०'\n `1 O . enam suuryaH na pratapati = sun will not parch him; maaruthaH paarshve na vaati = Air-god will not puff at his sides; chalormimaalii = the lord of undulating waves; samudraH api = ocean, even; tam dRistvaa na kampate = will not pulsate on seeing him [Ravana].` The Sun-god will not verily parch Ravana, the Air-god will not puff at his sides, and on seeing Ravana, the lord of the undulating waves, namely the ocean will not pulsate either. [1-15-1 O ]\n *And ocean hides those undulating waves from Ravana for the waves are his wives whom Ravana may abduct as in the case of Seetha.* \n 'तन्महन्नो भयं तस्माद्राक्षसाद्घोरदर्शनात् | वधार्थं तस्य भगवन्नुपायं कर्तुमर्हसि || १-१५-११'\n `11. tat = by that reason; ghoradarshanaat tasmaat raakShasaat = from that demon with an awesome sight; naH mahat bhayam = great panic for us; bhagavan = oh god; tasya vadhaartham = for purpose of his elimination; upaayam kartum arhasi = apt of you to make an idea.` Thereby, there is a great panic for all of us from that demon with an awesome look, hence oh, god, it will be apt of you to give a thought for his elimination. [1-15-11]\n \n 'एवमुक्तः सुरैः सर्वैः चिन्तयित्वा ततोऽब्रवीत् | हन्तायं विदितस्तस्य वधोपायो दुरात्मनः || १-१५-१२'\n `12. sarvaiH suraiH evam uktaH =[Brahma] is spoken this way by all gods; chintayitvaa tataH abraviit = on thinking, then, said; tasya duraatmanaH = that, evil minded ones; ayam vadhopaayaH = this is the, idea for elimination; viditaH hanta = known, aha.` When all the deities spoke to Brahma thus, he thought for a while and then said Aha! The idea to kill that evil-minded Ravana is discerned. [1-15-12]\n \n 'तेन गन्धर्वयक्षाणां देवतानां च रक्षसाम् | अवध्योऽस्मीति वागुक्ता तथेक्तं च तन्मया || १-१५-१३'\n `13. tena = by him [Ravana]; gandharvayakShaanaam = for gandharva-s and for yaksha-s; devataanam ca raakShasaam = by gods and other demons, also; avadhyaH asmi iti = I shall be not killable, thus; vaak uktaa = words, were uttered [by Ravana]; mayaa cha tat tathaa iti uktam = thus that way said by me.` Ravana said while seeking boon that, I shall not be killed by gandharva-s, yaksha-s, or by gods, or by other demons... and I also said so be it... [1-15-13]\n \n 'नाकीर्तयदवज्ञानात्तद्रक्षो मानुषांस्तदा | तस्मात् स मानुषाद्वध्यो मृत्युर्नान्योऽस्य विद्यते || १-१५-१४'\n `14. tat rakShaH = that, demon; avaj~aanaat = with disrespect; tataH = then; maanuShaan na akiirtayat = not articulated about humans; tasmaat = therefore; saH maanuSaat vadhyaH = he can be killed by human; [asya = his] mRityuH na anyaH vidyate = otherwise death is not evident.` That demon did not express about humans then with his disrespect to them, and evidently his death does not occur otherwise. So said Brahma to gods. [1-15-14]\n \n 'एतच्छ्रुत्वा प्रियं वाक्यं ब्रह्मणा समुदाहृतम् | देवा महर्षयः सर्वे प्रहृष्टास्तेऽभवंस्तदा ||१-१५-१५'\n `15. brahmaNaaH samudaahRitam = well explained by Brahma; etat priyam vaakyam = this, pleasant, word; shrutvaa = having heard; tataH = then; te devaaH maharSayaH = those, gods, great sages; sarve prahRiSTaaH abhavan = all became delighted.` On hearing Brahma explaining himself, then all those gods and great sages became adequately happy. [1-15-15]\n \n 'एतस्मिन्नन्तरे विष्णुरुपयातो महाद्युतिः | श्ङ्खचक्रगदापाणिः पीतवासा जगत्पतिः || १-११५-१६\n वैनतेयं समारुह्य भास्करस्तोयदं यथा | तप्तहाटककेयूरो वन्द्यमानः सुरोत्तमैः || १-१५-१७'\n `16, 17. etasmin antare = in the mean while; mahaadyutiH = great resplendent god; shankhachakragadaapaaaNiH = [with] conch disc mace in his [four] hands; piitavaasaaH = [with] yellow robes; jagatpatiH = Lord of Universe; vainateyam samaaruhya = mounted on Lady Vinatas son, GaruDa; bhaaskaraH toyadam yathaa = Sun, on water giver [sun on black cloud,] like; taptahaaTakakeyuuraH = burnt [refined,] gold, bracelets; vandyamaanaH surottamaiH = while eulogised, by the best gods; viSNuH = Vishnu; upayaataH = arrived.` In the meanwhile the great resplendent Vishnu, the Lord of the Universe, arrived there mounted on his Eagle-vehicle Garuda, handling conch-shell, disc, and mace in his three of four hands, clad in yellow-ochre robes, wearing golden bracelets, and while best gods eulogised him, and his arrival there is like the arrival of sun mounted on black cloud to accord the gratuitous gift called the rain. [1-15-16, 17]\n *Vishnu is a four handed deity. He handles a Divine Lotus suggesting that he is the creator sRiSTikartaa. An ever-cycling disc called sudarshana-chakra is handled symbolising his ever-lasting dynamism. He is the maintainer of that continuous dynamism of already created Universe sthiti-kartaa. A mace called kaumodakii for bludgeoning enemies as he is the eradicator of evil samhaarakartaa, and a conch-shell called paanchajanya which produces the sound of Om, listening to which salvation, mukti, is achieved by the true devotee. The sound of the same conch shell gives out an unbearable sound in respect of enemies. He is entered here without a lotus in hand. That means there is no need for a creation afresh. The other items he is handling are enough to deal with Ravana. If the Lotus is not handled that hand is taken as a blessing hand, abhayahasta. And now he is giving that a+bhaya no fear, an assurance, to all gods.\n The expression that Vishnu has come on his eagle-vehicle has a cross-reference to the previous chapters garuDa-yajnavedi , Eagle-shaped Altar of Fire that is laid by priests of Dasharatha. It will be laid so with assumption that Garuda, also called suparNa, the Divine Eagle will fly in to transport oblations. The Vedic ritual is also called suparNa, the golden winged, or great winged vehicle to conduct oblations. And the eagle-vehicle of Vishnu is the quickest carrier of oblations to the deities specified in Vedic hymn. Here this Garuda has already carried the oblations offered by King Dasharatha to the chanting of Vedic hymns by Sage Rishyasringa to Vishnu. So Vishnu is now coming mounted on the same meritorious carrier, namely Garuda. Secondly the simile of Suns coming mounted on a black cloud has some thing to do with yajna. A silver cloud is no value in giving rains. The rain has got an inseparable combination with Vedic ritual. Since the ritual of Dasharatha is going to fructify the rainfall is due on earth. Hence, the sun on collecting all the merits called the rituals of Dasharatha, in the form waters is coming riding on a black cloud to shower rains. Hence Vishnu and Sun both are ready now shower their graces. Vishnu will shower grace by eradicating the evil called Ravana, and the sun by showering the gratuitous and cooling rains.*\n 'ब्रह्मणा च समागम्य तत्र तस्थौ समाहितः | तमब्रुवन् सुराः सर्वे समभिष्टूय संनताः || १-१५-१८'\n `18. brahmaNaa samaagamya = having met with Brahma; tatra tasthau samaahitaH = there, he stood, contemplating; suraaH sarve sannataaH = gods, all, bowing down; tam samabhiSTuuya abruvan = said to him on offering prayers.` Vishnu having met Brahma stood there contemplating, and then all of the gods on bowing down and offering prayers addressed Vishnu.

[1-15-19, 2 O , 21a]\n *These three hrii, shrii, kiirti are the daughters of Daksha Prajapati in their earlier births. The hrii is hRillekha , virtuous disposition - which Queen Kausalya has, and who begot Rama. The shrii is shriikaara , the affluence of everything, which Queen Sumitra has, by which alone she magnificently and unhesitatingly advises her son Lakshmana to go along with Rama to woods. And the third, kiirti, the glory, and the glory of Kaika is well known. The position of this epic minus Kaika can be imagined, thereby her glory, may it be negative, that may be imagined.*\n 'तत्र त्वं मानुषो भूत्वा प्रवृद्धं लोककण्टकम् || १-१५-२१ अवध्यं दैवतैर्विष्णो समरे जहि रावणम् |'\n `21b, 22a. viSNo = oh Vishnu; tvam = you; tatra = in them [the wombs of queens]; maanuSaH bhuutva = on becoming [taking birth] as human; pravRiddham = who is exacerbating; lokakanTakam = one who is thorny to worlds; daivataiH avadhyam = not killable by gods; raavaNam samare jahi = Ravana be killed in war.` Oh!

And to Kaikeyi he gave half of the remaining half, i.e., one eight of the dessert, with a desire to beget sons. Then thinking for a while gave the remaining, i.e., one-eighth portion again to queen Sumitra. Thus, the king distributed the dessert to his wives differently. [1-16-27, 28, 29]\n *This is a much-discussed distribution by the traditionalists. Adhyaatma Ramayana, a treatise that postulates god-hood to Rama, gives a well-constructed argument about these shares of dessert and the resultant births of the four brothers, viz., Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata, and Shatrughna, in accordance with these shares. In its simplest terms and as contained in these verses, queen Kausalya got half of the dessert as an Empress, paTTa-mahiSi. Sumitra gets one-fourth in the first round and after a rethink by Dasharatha, she gets another one-eighth portion. Kaikeyi gets only a one-eighth quantity. Thus, Kausalya gives birth to Rama, Sumitra to Lakshmana and Shatrughna, and Kaikeyi to Bharata. The quantum of apportionment of the dessert does not make Rama all-powerful or Bharata the least. Since the Absolute is indivisible into parts, the dessert that is divided is not to be taken as the divided Absolute, but a kind of medium through which the incarnation is made possible. \n There is another declination enquiring whether the incarnation of Rama is full or partial, puurNa-avatara or ardha-avatara... Rama is Vishnu Himself while Bharata and Shatrughna are his disc and conch-shell, while Lakshmana is the thousand headed snake aadisheSha on whose coils Vishnu reclines. The whole dessert is divine and parts of it do not signify and inter-divided god-hoods. Hence, the apportionment of the desert is done in order to keep up the hierarchy of the queen-hoods and their status. Throughout this magnum opus Rama never said that he is god or an incarnate of god, but called himself, nimitta-maatra a casual relation to the course of events. Should Rama be the incarnation of the Almighty Himself, he has little or no necessity to incarnate the weaponry along with him. They are at his beck and call at any time. Thus, Rama is neither a half nor one-fourth incarnation of the Absolute nor a dividend of the whole, but an incarnate of the virtuously ideal personality of Vishnu, maryaadaa purushottama Rama. \n Incidental to this apportionment of the dessert, the aspect of eldest son is also studied. Rama is the first-born and thus the eldest. This is because the dessert is given to queen Kausalya in the first instance, and half of the whole vessel. She immediately consumed to lionise her share and as an Empress. Sumitra waited a while till apportionment is complete. Kaikeyi got her portion but waited till her elder sister Sumitra completes her drink. In the meanwhile Dasharatha thought a while, as said in the verse, and gave Sumitra another one-eighth part. Sumitra then consumed her two parts. Later Kaikeyi drinks her dividend.*\n 'ताश्चैवं पायसं प्राप्य नरेन्द्रस्योत्तमाः स्त्रियः | सम्मानं मेनिरे सर्वाः प्रहर्षोदितचेतसः || १-१६-३०'\n `3 O . narendrasya uttamaaH striyaH = best ladies of king; sarvaaH = all of them; taaH evam paayasam praapya = they, on getting dessert that way; praharSoditachetasaH = exuberance gladness with hearts; sammaanam menire = a reward, they deemed [the dessert.]` On getting the dessert all of those best ladies of the king, whose hearts are exuberant with happiness, deemed it as a reward.

The fruit of ritual is obtained in the shape of dessert, and Kausalya consumed half of it, but it is not half of Vishnu as he is illimitable. Even Sreenivasa Aiyangar took it as half, in saying half of Vishnus essence is Rama. This has become a perennial topic debating whether the incarnation of Rama is a pUrNaavatAra, ardhaavatAra or aMshaavatAra.*\n 'कौसल्या शुशुभे तेन पुत्रेणामिततेजसा | यथा वरेण देवानामदितिर्वज्रपाणिना || १-१८-१२'\n `12. kausalya = queen Kausalya; amitatejasaa = one with unlimited resplendence; tena putreNa = by that, son; devaanaam vareNa = the best among gods; vajrapaaNinaa = by Thunderbolt in hand [wielder - Indra]; aditiH yathaa shushubhe = shone forth as Lady Aditi.` Kausalya shone forth with such a son whose resplendence is unlimited, as with lady Aditi who once stood out with her son Indra, the best one among gods.

[1-18-13]\n *The fraction indicated here like one fourth of Vishnu etc may be reckoned as the share of the dessert consumed by the queens, but not as a cleaved portion of Vishnu as he is an indivisible entity. Here it is half of one-fourth i.e., one-eighth of dessert given to Kaikeyi.*\n 'अथ लक्ष्मणशत्रुघ्नौ सुमित्राजनयत् सुतौ | वीरौ सर्वास्त्रकुशलौ विष्णोरर्धसमन्वितौ | १-१८-१४'\n `14. atha = then; sumitraa = Queen Sumitra; viirau = valiant ones; sarvaastrakushalau = experts in all weaponry; viSNoH = Vishnus; ardhasamanvitau = those that are embodied with essence epitome; lakShmaNashatrughnau = Lakshmana and Shatrughna; sutau ajanayat = gave birth to sons.` Queen Sumitra then gave birth to two sons who are the embodied epitomes of Vishnu, namely Lakshmana, and Shatrughna, who are valiant ones and experts in all kinds of weaponry.

The ninth is called AshleSh, or the snake. It is evident from this that Bharata, though his birth is mentioned before that of the twins, was the youngest of the four brothers and Ramas junior by eleven months -- Schlegel. \n The eleven-month gap between Rama and Bharata is unapparent in the words of verse. This may be from some other version of Ramayana. *\n 'राज्ञः पुत्रा महात्मानश्चत्वारो जज्ञिरे पृथक् | गुणवंतोऽनुरूपाश्च रुच्या प्रोष्ठपदोपमाः || १-१८-१६'\n `16. guNavantaH anuruupaaH cha = virtuous ones, charming, also; ruchyaa = by brilliance; proSTapada upamaaH = [like puurva bhaadra, uttara bhaadra] stars, in simile; mahaatmaanaH = great souls; such; raajnaH putraa = kings, sons; chatvaaraH = four of them; jaj~nire pRithak = born, separately.`\n Thus there are four great-souled sons of Dasharatha, born on separate instances, who are virtuous, charming, and by brilliance they are in similitude with two stars of each of the asterisms called puurvaabhaadra and uttaraabhaadra. [1-18-16]\n *The word proSTa is cow; pada feet; the feet of a cow. It is also the name for the asterisms puurvaabhaadra, uttaraabaadra, containing stars in the wing of Pegasus, each of which will have two stars, and all the four stars make a perfect square. Like the pairs of stars the brother also move in pairs - Rama, Lakshmana; Bharata, Shatrughna.\n The epithet mahaatmaanaH high-souled ones is though negligible for peripheral reading, it is explained as: Rama is one such, as he undertakes svadharmaanuSThaana ; Lakshmana by his sheSatvaj~naana ; Bharata by his bhagavatpaaratantrya ; and Shatrughna by his bhaagavata-paaratantrya. \n Like this, each of the epithets used in Ramayana has something or the other meaning which is not generally recorded in English translations. All the English translations are story-oriented, as though there is some unknown story in Ramayana for retelling afresh. In the spate of telling story again and again these niceties are lost. The same is the position with the numerous epithets given to Seetha in Aranya Kanda. Readers may please note that each epithet conveys some meaning and if we could not incorporate them, it is our misfortune in getting a book containing their meanings. We request the readers to kindly inform us if they have come across the meanings of these seemingly useless and metre-filling-like epithets in any book, so that, that book will be brought to the notice of readers who are mistaking them as redundant stanza fillers. *\n 'जगुः कलं च गंधर्वा ननृतुश्चाप्सरोगणाः | देवदुंदुभयो नेदुः पुष्पवृष्टिश्च खात्पतत् || १-१८-१७ उत्सवश्च महानासीदयोध्यायां जनाकुलः |'\n `17, 18a. gandharvaaH kalam jaguH = celestial singers, melodiously, sang; apsarogaNaaH nanRituH = groups of divine dancers - dancing parties, danced; devadundubhayaH neduH = divine drums, sounded; khaat pushpavRiSTiH cha patat = from heavens, flowery, rain, also, fallen; ayodhyaayaam janaakulaH = with people thronging in Ayodhya ; utsavaH cha mahaan aasiit = great festivity also is there.` The celestial singers sang melodiously, paradisiacal dancing parties danced, divine drums drummed and heavens rained flowers, with all this there is a great festivity in Ayodhya with thronging people.

[1-19-14b, 15a]\n *These verses are commented extensively by early commentators. In 14th verse, the pronoun aham, I used by Sage Vishvamitra is to announce definiteness about his own stature to know the Absolute vis-a-vis the Absolute Himself. Vishvamitra was an emperor who left off everything. He was primarily a raajarShi, kingly sage, later became brahmarShi and performed mokShakaameSTi. That is a highest ascesis for achieving salvation. Whereas Dasharatha performed Vedic ritual called putrakaameSTi, ritual for begetting sons, as he is still involved in earthly passions. Thus he is still in karmic cycle and recently went under the veil of moha, worldly delusion, advent to the birth of sons. So Dasharatha cannot know who Rama is. All these aspects are said to qualify that expression aham, i.e., I am, as said by Vishvamitra.\n He also says aham vedmi , it is not just I know but I am in full knowledge of Rama and it is immediately followed by mahaatmaanam, about the sublime soul Rama. Rama is at present a twelve-year lad, and Dasharatha should have enquired how a boy is said to be a sublime-soul. Dasharatha did not bother to enquire about the high souled property of his son, because of his newfound fondness for sons. But, Vishvamitra is in full knowledge as to who Rama is, and says Rama is a sublime-soul, as contained in scripture puruSasuukta which says vedaahametam puruSam mahaantam, and as in yo maam pashyati sarvatra....sa ca Me na praNasyati Bhagavad Gita, 6-3 O , as well. \n In next foot at 15th verse, Vishvamitra argues that he is not just extolling Rama to achieve his personal purpose, i.e., the completion of ritual. He says, vashiSTho api even Sage Vashishta, knows Rama. Here the word api , even, is said to have been used to qualify Vashishta as an antagonist of Vishvamitra in policy differences. Even my opponent, this Sage Vashishta, the descendent of Goddess Saraswati and Brahma, and a brahmarSi, Absolute-knower, and at whose instance I became a brahmarSi from raajarSi , is aware of Rama... is the argument of Vishvamitra, stressing his neutrality in seeking Ramas help. \n Still Vishvamitra tells that ye cheme tapasi sthitaaH , those sages that are here who are rooted in ascesis as in the vein of puruSasuukta which says tasya dhiiraaH pratijaananti yonim. Vishvamitras argument is Sage Vashishta may take sides with you, because he is rajaguru , the royal priest, while the others like Kaashyapa, Vaamadeva will tell you clearly, as they have no leaning on your court. \n All said and done, King Dasharatha is still lingering for a reply. Seeing that Vishvamitra further says, if you want to achieve renown, send Rama. No father rejoices that much when a son is birthed than on his achieving reputation. Dasharatha is advised in the same way when saying yadi dharmalaabham, yasho laabham if you want renown through a worthy son, who will be renowned in all three worlds by his coming with me, then you send Rama... \n Now Ramas reputation is going to be enhanced by Sage Vishvamitra in eliminating demoness Tataka, in releasing Ahalya from her curse, breaking Shivas bow, marriage with Seetha, rebuffing Parashuraama etc. And also Vishvamitra leaves the decision to Dasharatha, if only your ministers, clergy as well political, permit then alone you send Rama with me... *\n  'यदि ते धर्मलाभं तु यशश्च परमं भुवि || १-१९-१५ स्थिरमिच्छसि राजेन्द्र रामं मे दातुमर्हसि |'\n `15b, 16a. raajendra = oh best king; te dharmalaabham icChasi yadi = if you desire to gain in value of probity; paramam yashaH cha = paramount, renown, also; bhuvi sthitam = that is abiding on earth - long-lasting; [if you desire]; ramam me daatum arhasi = apt of you to handover Rama to me.` If you wish to gain in value of probity, a long-lasting and paramount renown on earth it will be apt of you to handover Rama to me. [1-19-15b, 16a]\n  'यद्यभ्यनुज्ञां काकुत्स्थ ददते तव मंत्रिणः || १-१९-१६ वसिष्ठप्रमुखाः सर्वे ततो रामं विसर्जय |'\n `16b, 17a. kakutstha = oh king from Kakutstha dynasty, Dasharatha; tava mantriNaH = your, ministers; vasiSThapramukhaaH sarve = Vashishta and other elite, all of them; abhyanuj~naam dadate yadi = if they give assent; tataH ramam visarjaya = then, Rama be, let out - send with me.` Oh, Dasharatha, you may send Rama if only your ministers and all the other elite headed by Vashishta are going to give assent. [1-19-16b, 17a]\n  'अभिप्रेतमसंसक्तमात्मजं दातुमर्हसि || १-१९-१७ दशरात्रं हि यज्ञस्य रामं राजीवलोचनम् |'\n `17b, 18a. abhipretam = choicest one; aatmajam = your son; raamam rajiivalochanam = Rama, lotus eyed one; a samsaktam = without your close attachment - without further delay; yaj~nasya dasharaatram hi = just for rituals ten nights [days also included - ten days] ; daatum arhasi = apt of you to let out.` It will be apt of you to send your choicest son, the lotus-eyed Rama, just for ten days of the ritual without temporising. [1-19-17b, 18a]\n  'नात्येति कालो यज्ञस्य यथायं मम राघव || १-१९-१८ तथा कुरुष्व भद्रं ते मा च शोके मनः कृथाः |'\n `18b, 19a. raaghava = oh Raghava - Dasharatha; mama yaj~nasya ayam kaalaH = my, rituals, this, time; yathaa na atyeti = as to how, not, becomes lapsed; tathaa kuruSva = that way, you do - take decision; shoke manaH maa kRithaaH = not be rendered heart in grief; bhadram te = safety be to you.` I wish you to take decision as to how my rituals time is not lapsed, and let safety betide you, let not your heart be rendered to grieve. Thus Vishvamitra said to Dasharatha.

[1-2 O -2]\n *This particular statement uunaSoDashavarSaH less than sixteen years, has evoked a spate of commentaries in deciding the age of Rama at this juncture of going along with Sage Viswamitra, i.e., at the time of his marrying Seeta and at the time of his exile to forests etc. His age is said to be twelve years as of now. And this is confirmed by Mareecha while advising Ravana, that as a boy of twelve Rama, killed my mother and brother, and hit me out as at 3-38-6, uunadvaadashavarSaH Or, baalo dvaadashavarSo ayam as per other versions of the same verse. \n Ramayana has some bearing on the number twelve. The Books or Kaanda-s are 6, half of twelve. The total verses are 24 thousand, two folds of twelve thousand. Rama is born in twelfth month. Vishvamitras arrival, or better said as Seethaa-kalyaaNa , Seethas marriage with Rama, is in the twelfth year. His stay in Ayodhya before crown prince ceremony and exile is for twelve years. The years of Ramas exile are twelve, plus two years stay in Panchavati, of the total fourteen years of exile. In Uttara Ramayana Seethas exile in the hermitage of Valmiki is for twelve years. So on...\n Some others said that because Rama has not yet attained all the sixteen phases like full moon, he is not a full-fledged person, chaaru SoDashakalaasahitaH Again in saying: raajiivalochana lotus-eyed one - petals of lotuses close down by night, so Ramas eyelids too close by night for a boyish sleep. Then how can such a boy war with night-active demons? In answer to this Sage Vishvamitra uses the same wording in previous chapter at 1-19-18, dasharaatram; raamam raajiivalocanam where the wording raajiivalocana is used by Vishvamitra in the sense that the petals of a lotus spread out on the first rays of sun. So also the very opening of the lotus-petal eyelids of Rama will eradicate the nightly menace of demons with his Omniscient Sun-Moon-Fire eyes, suuryachandraagnilochanaH , that can see even in night. \n A Kshatriya of sixteen years age is unfit to war with any one, as he is still a childhood baalaH aaSoDashaavarSaH . But Rama is under sixteen, and he is being requisitioned for war. Can he combat even if he is under aged? Yes, he can, says Govindaraja as per the nyaya /syndrome, tejasaam hi na vayaH samiikShyate dextrous persons age is not to be reckoned As such, though Rama appears to be under aged he can do wonders in eliminating the vice. This is again rounded off with Vishvamitras wording in last chapter: aham vedmi mahaatmaanam raamam raajiivalocanam. *\n  'इयमक्षौहिणी पूर्णा यस्याहं पतिरीश्वरः | अनया संवृतो गत्वा योद्धाहं तैर्निशाचरैः || १-२०-३'\n `3. puurNaa iyam akShouhiNii = this full-fledged one - here is, battalion [of ancient Indian warfare]; yasya aham patiH = for which, I am, the leader; iishwaraH = controller; anayaa samvRitaH = surrounded - [fortified by] by this [battalion] ; gatvaa = having gone; aham taiH nishaacharaiH yoddhaa = I can encounter with those night walkers [demons] .` Here is the full-fledged battalion, called akShouhiNii senaa , for which I am the leader and controller, and fortified by this army I will go there to encounter those demons.

[1-23-1 O , 11]\n *The meaning of kandarpa is one who is carnally prideful, i.e., he who takes pride in arousing lecherousness. And kaama is 'desire' the natural basic instinct of any animal, and the one which the sages and saints want to overcome, so they named Love-god from their point of view. In these verses the two words kRitodvaaham , and their meaning as on marrying Parvati and going this way with his coterie etc., is held incongruous to other mythological episodes of Shivas marriage with Parvati, and Manmathas effort to enkindle love in Shiva. After marriage with Parvati, some argue, where is the question of Love-gods interference to inculcate love in Shiva. It is clear in RamaCharitaMaanas how this Shiva-Parvati marriage occurs. And some give the meaning like this: kRita where kRi= karaNe udvaaham tu devesham = to actualise, marriage, only, of Shiva; gacChantam on going there, Love-god, samarudgaNam with Wind-gods and other deities; dharSayaamaasa started to attack Shiva. The Love-god on going there to that hermitage that is being described by Vishvamitra along with Wind-gods et al, with an intention to get the marriage of Shiva performed, assailed Shiva. *\n  'अवध्यतश्च रौद्रेण चक्षुषा रघुनन्दन | व्यशीर्यन्त शरीरात् स्वात् सर्वगात्राणि दुर्मतेः || १-२३-१२'\n `12. raghunandana = Raghus legatee - Rama; raudreNa chakShuShaa avadhyataH = one who is destroyed with wrathful eye [third eye]; durmateH = lewd-minded ones; svaat = from his own; shariiraat sarvagaatraaNi = body, all limbs; vyashiiryanta = fall down.` \"And Rama, the wrathful third-eye of Shiva destroyed the lewd-minded Love-god making all his limbs to fall down from his body. [1-23-12]\n * The word avadhyataH is otherwise said in other texts as avadagdhasya raudreNa cakShuSaa, to derive a clear meaning of 'burnt down,' because avadhyataH is just killing, slaying, whereas Shivas third-eye truly burns down anything where even ashes do not remain. The critical editions have this as dagdhasya tasya raudreNa chakShuShA *\n  'तत्र गात्रं हतं तस्य निर्दग्धस्य महात्मनः | अशरीरः कृतः कामः क्रोधाद्देवेश्वरेण ह || १-२३-१३'\n `13. mahaatmanaH = by great soul [ Shiva]; nirdagdhasya = completely burnt down; tasya gaatram = his, body; tatra hatam = there, dissipated; deveshvareNa krodhaat = by god of gods - Shiva, by his anger; kaamaH ashariiraH kRitaH = made Love-god as body less one.` \"There the body of Love-god is evanesced when that great soul Shiva burnt it down, and by the anger of that god of gods Shiva, Love-god is rendered as a bodiless entity. [1-23-13]\n * Manmatha and his wife Rati will have supremely exquisite physiques. At the very sight of Manmatha everybody used to become a prey to lasciviousness. So Shiva had to completely burn down that physical form of love, whereby only kaama, the mental desire, is remaining. *\n  'अनङ्ग इति विख्यातस्तदाप्रभृति राघव | स चाङ्गविषयः श्रीमान् यत्राङ्गं स मुमोच ह || १-२३-१४'\n `14. tadaaprabhRiti = from then onwards; Raghava; anangaH = without body - Love-god; iti vikhyaataH = thus, renowned as; yatra angam pramumocha ha = where gave up body, indeed; saH cha = that, also; shriimaan = prosperous one - Love-god; angaviSayaH = [that is] Anga, province.` Then onwards Love-god is renowned as Ananga, as he is without body, and where his body is given up that is renowned as Anga province.

So said Vishvamitra to Rama. [1-24-32]\n . * The epithets in Ramayana \n The epithets used in epic may be on the increase from now, and they may not be construed as redundant foot fillers. All have implicit meanings and they can be understood with the help of commentaries. As this work cannot include voluminous commentaries, many of the meanings of epithets as said by commentators are not incorporated. This bypassing will not effect the ordinary narration. For e.g., the meaning to the words munipungava, narashaarduula will be the eminent saint tigerly man. And trying to obtain a squeezed meaning from them would be futile, without resorting to some commentary. So also, there are words like indra, candra, simha, shaarduula, naaga, vRiSabha, pungava which when suffixed to vocatives will mean best, choicest, excellent etc., as per simha-shaarduula-naagaadyaaH pumsi shreSTaarthagocharaaH . But commentators have explained why that character is best or excellent, or a lion at that juncture. For e.g., dharmaatmaathe apparently usual epithet in Ramayana has many meanings like – 1] one whose life is dharma; 2] one whose body is dharma incarnate; 3] one whose soul is filled with dharma; 4] one whose entity itself is dharma – so on, basing on the thesaurus of aatmathat say as: aatmaa yatna-dhRiti-svaanta-svabhaava-paramaatmaasu jiiva-buddhi- shariireSu.. \n So also, more than often Seetha will be referred as Vaidehi or Maithili in Aranya Kanda. Some details about it are incorporated in that book. Wherever possible those niceties will be included subject to availability of commentaries, which commentaries have already became the flowers in the sky. \n Hence, without trying to squeeze meaningless meanings, and leaving this aspect to pundits and researchers, and as this work cannot be stuffed with those intricacies, henceforth the meanings of epithets are said simply, and at times ignored also. This may please be kept in view while reading. *\n  'इति वाल्मीकिरामायणे आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे चतुर्विंशः सर्गः ||'"
