Then, having heard that great tumult, Arjuna and Sri Krsna the Lord of all lords, who was acting as the charioteer of Arjuna, sitting in their great chariot which was powerful enough to coner the three worlds; blew their divine conchs Srimad Pancajanya and Devadatta. Then, both Yudhisthira and Bhima blew their respective conchs separately. That tumult rent asunder the hearts of your sons, led by Duryodhana.

Then, having heard that great tumult, Arjuna and Sri Krsna the Lord of all lords, who was acting as the charioteer of Arjuna, sitting in their great chariot which was powerful enough to coner the three worlds; blew their divine conchs Srimad Pancajanya and Devadatta. Then, both Yudhisthira and Bhima blew their respective conchs separately. That tumult rent asunder the hearts of your sons, led by Duryodhana. The sons of Dhrtarastra then thought, 'Our cause is almost lost now itself.' So said Sanjaya to Dhrtarastra who was longing for their victory. Sanjaya said to Dhrtarastra: Then, seeing the Kauravas, who were ready for battle, Arjuna, who had Hanuman, noted for his exploit of burning Lanka, as the emblem on his flag on his chariot, directed his charioteer Sri Krsna, the Supreme Lord-who is overcome by parental love for those who take shelter in Him who is the treasure-house of knowledge, power, lordship, energy, potency and splendour, whose sportive delight brings about the origin, sustentation and dissolution of the entire cosmos at His will, who is the Lord of the senses, who controls in all ways the senses inner and outer of all, superior and inferior - by saying, 'Station my chariot in an appropriate place in order that I may see exactly my enemies who are eager for battle.'"

After saying so, Arjuna surrendered himself at the feet of the Lord, overcome with dejection, saying. 'Teach me, your disciple, who has taken refuge in you, what is good for me.'"

Thus, has it been said by Sri Yamunacarya: 'The introduction to the Sastra was begun for the sake of Arjuna, whose mind was agitated by misplaced love and compassion and by the delusion that righteousness was unrighteousness, and who took refuge in Sri Krsna.' The Supreme Person spoke these words as if smiling, and looking at Arjuna, who was thus overcome by grief resulting from ignorance about the real nature of the body and the self, but was nevertheless speaking about duty as if he had an understanding that the self is distinct from the body, and while he (Arjuna), torn between contradictory ideas, had suddenly become inactive standing between the two armies that were getting ready to fight. Sri Krsna said, as if in ridicule, to Arjuna the words beginning with, 'There never was a time when I did not exist' (II. 12), and ending with 'I will release you from all sins; grieve not!' (XVIII. 66) - which have for their contents the real nature of the self, of the Supreme Self, and of the paths of work (Karma), knowledge (Jnana) and devotion (Bhakti) which constitute the means for attaining the highest spiritual fulfilment."

मोह आदि जो संसारके बीजभूत दोष है उनकी उत्पत्तिका कारण दिखलानेके लिये है। क्योंकि कथं भीष्ममहं संख्ये इत्यादि श्लोकोंद्वारा अर्जुनने इसी तरह राज्य गुरु पुत्र मित्र सुहृद स्वजन सम्बन्धी और बान्धवोंके विषयमें यह मेरे हैं मैं इनका हूँ इस प्रकार अज्ञानजनित स्नेहविच्छेद आदि कारणोंसे होनेवाले अपने शोक और मोह दिखाये हैं। यद्यपि ( वह अर्जुन ) स्वयं ही पहले क्षात्रधर्मरूप युद्धमें प्रवृत्त हुआ था तो भी शोकमोहके द्वारा विवेकविज्ञानके दब जानेपर ( वह ) उस युद्धसे रुक गया और भिक्षाद्वारा जीवननिर्वाह करना आदि दूसरोंके धर्मका आचरण करनेके लिये प्रवृत्त हो गया। इसी तरह शोकमोह आदि दोषोंसे जिनका चित्त घिरा हुआ हो ऐसे सभी प्राणियोंसे स्वधर्मका त्याग और निषिद्ध धर्मका सेवन स्वाभाविक ही होता है।    यदि वे स्वधर्मपालनमें लगे हुए हों तो भी उनके मन वाणी और शरीरादिकी प्रवृत्ति फलाकांक्षापूर्वक और अहंकारसहित ही होती है। ऐसा होनेसे पुण्यपाप दोनों बढ़ते रहनेके कारण अच्छेबुरे जन्म और सुखदुःखोंकी प्राप्तिरूप संसार निवृत्त नहीं हो पाता अतः शोक और मोह यह दोनों संसारके बीजरूप हैं। इन दोनोंकी निवृत्ति सर्वकर्मसंन्यासपूर्वक आत्मज्ञानके अतिरिक्त अन्य उपायसे नहीं हो सकती। अतः उसका ( आत्मज्ञानका ) उपदेश करने की इच्छावाले भगवान् वासुदेव सब लोगोंपर अनुग्रह करने के लिये अर्जुनको निमित्त बनाकर कहने लगे अशोच्यान् इत्यादि। इसपर कितने ही टीकाकार कहते हैं कि केवल सर्वकर्मसंन्यासपूर्वक आत्मज्ञाननिष्ठामात्रसे ही कैवल्यकी ( मोक्षकी ) प्राप्ति नहीं हो सकती किंतु अग्निहोत्रादि श्रौतस्मार्तकर्मोंसहित ज्ञानसे मोक्षकी प्राप्ति होती है यही सारी गीताका निश्चित अभिप्राय है। इस अर्थमें वे प्रमाण भी बतलाते हैं जैसे अथ चेत्त्वमिमं धम्यं सङ्ग्रामं न करिष्यसि कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते कुरु कर्मैव तस्मात्त्वम् इत्यादि। ( वे यह भी कहते हैं कि ) हिंसा आदिसे युक्त होनेके कारण वैदिक कर्म अधर्मका कारण है ऐसी शंका भी नहीं करनी चाहिये क्योंकि गुरु भ्राता और पुत्रादिकी हिंसा ही जिसका स्वरूप है ऐसा अत्यन्त क्रूर युद्धरूप क्षात्रकर्म भी स्वधर्म माना जानेके कारण अधर्मका हेतु नहीं है ऐसा कहनेवाले तथा उसके न करनेमें ततः स्वधर्म कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि इस प्रकार दोष बतलानेवाले भगवान्का यह कथन तो पहले ही सुनिश्चित हो जाता है कि जीवनपर्यन्त कर्म करें इत्यादि श्रुतिवाक्योंद्वारा वर्णित पशु आदिकी हिंसारूप कर्मोंको करना अधर्म नहीं है। परंतु वह ( उन लोगोंका कहना ) ठीक नहीं है क्योंकि भिन्नभिन्न दो बुद्धियोंके आश्रित रहनेवाली ज्ञाननिष्ठा और कर्मनिष्ठाका अलगअलग वर्णन है। अशोच्यान् इस श्लोकसे लेकर स्वधर्ममपि चावेक्ष्य इस श्लोकके पहलेके प्रकरणसे भगवान्ने जिस परमार्थआत्मतत्त्वका निरूपण किया है वह सांख्य है तद्विषयक जो बुद्धि है अर्थात् आत्मामें जन्मादि छहों विकारोंका अभाव होनेके कारण आत्मा अकर्ता है इस प्रकारका जो निश्चय उक्त प्रकरणके अर्थका विवेचन करनेसे उत्पन्न होता है वह सांख्यबुद्धि है वह जिन ज्ञानियोंके लिये उचित होती है ( जो उसके अधिकारी हैं ) वे सांख्ययोगी हैं। इस ( उपर्युक्त ) बुद्धिके उत्पन्न होनेसे पहलेपहले आत्माका देहादिसे पृथक्पन कर्तापन और भोक्तापन माननेकी अपेक्षा रखनेवाला जो धर्मअधर्मके विवेकसे युक्त मार्ग है मोक्षसाधनोंका अनुष्ठान करनेके लिये चेष्टा करना ही जिसका स्वरूप है उसका नाम योग है और तद्विषयक जो बुद्धि है वह योगबुद्धि है वह जिन कर्मियोंके लिये उचित होती है ( जो उसके अधिकारी हैं ) वे योगी हैं। इसी प्रकार भगवान्ने एषा तेऽभिहिता सांख्ये बुद्धिर्योगे त्विमां श्रृणु इस श्लोकसे अलगअलग दो बुद्धियाँ दिखलायी हैं। उन दोनों बुद्धियोंमेंसे सांख्यबुद्धिके आश्रित रहनेवाली सांख्ययोगियोंकी ज्ञानयोगसे ( होनेवाली ) निष्ठाको पुरा वेदात्मना मया प्रोक्ता इत्यादि वचनोंसे अलग कहेंगे। तथा योगबुद्धिके आश्रित रहनेवाली कर्मयोगसे ( होनेवाली ) निष्ठाको कर्मयोगेन योगिनाम् इत्यादि वचनोंसे अलग कहेंगे। कर्तापनअकर्तापन और एकताअनेकताजैसी भिन्नभिन्न बुद्धिके आश्रित रहनेवाले जो ज्ञान और कर्म हैं उन दोनोंका एक पुरुषमें होना असम्भव माननेवाले भगवान्ने ही स्वयं उपर्युक्त प्रकारसे सांख्यबुद्धि और योगबुद्धिका आश्रय लेकर अलगअलग दो निष्टाएँ कही हैं। जिस प्रकार ( गीताशास्त्रमें ) इन दोनों निष्ठाओंका अलगअलग वर्णन है वैसे ही शतपथ ब्राह्मणमें भी दिखलाया गया है। ( वहाँ ) इस आत्मलोकको ही चाहनेवाले वैराग्यशील ब्राह्मण संन्यास लेते हैं इस प्रकार सर्वकर्मसंन्यासका विधान करके उसी वाक्यके शेष वाक्यसे कहा है कि जिन हमलोगोंका यह आत्मा ही लोक है ( वे हम ) सन्ततिसे क्या ( सिद्ध ) करेंगे। वहीं यह भी कहा है कि प्राकृत आत्मा अर्थात् अज्ञानी मनुष्य धर्मजिज्ञासाके बाद और विवाहसे पहले तीनों लोकोंकी प्राप्तिके साधनरूप पुत्रकी तथा दैव और मानुष ऐसे दो प्रकारके धनकी इच्छा करने लगा। इनमें पितृलोककी प्राप्तिका साधनरूप कर्म तो मानुष धन है और देवलोककी प्राप्तिका साधनरूप विद्या देवधन है। इस तरह ( उपर्युक्त श्रुतिमें ) अविद्या और कामनावाले पुरुषके लिये ही श्रौतादि सम्पूर्ण कर्म बताये गये हैं। उन सब ( कर्मों ) से निवृत्त होकर संन्यास ग्रहण करते हैं इस कथनसे केवल आत्मलोकको चाहनेवाले निष्कामी पुरुषके लिये संन्यासका ही विधान किया है। यदि ( इसपर भी यह बात मानी जायगी कि ) भगवान्को श्रौतकर्म और ज्ञानका समुच्चय इष्ट है तो यह उपर्युक्त विभक्त विवेचन अयोग्य ठहरेगा। तथा ( ऐसा मान लेनेसे ) ज्यायसी चेत्कर्मणस्ते इत्यादि जो अर्जुन का प्रश्न है वह भी नहीं बन सकता। यदि ज्ञान और कर्मका एक पुरुषद्वारा एक साथ किया जाना असम्भव और कर्मकी अपेक्षा ज्ञानका श्रेष्ठत्व भगवान्ने पहले न कहा होता तो इस तरह अर्जुन बिना सुनी हुई बातका झूठे ही भगवान्में अध्यारोप कैसे करता कि ज्यायसी चेत्कर्मणस्ते मता बुद्धिः। यदि सभीके लिये ज्ञान और कर्मका समुच्चय कहा होता तो अर्जुनके लिये भी वह कहा ही गया था फिर दोनोंका समुचित उपदेश होते हुए यच्छ्रेय एतयोरेकं तन्मे ब्रूहि सुनिश्चितम् इस प्रकार दोनोंमेंसे एकके ही सम्बन्धमें प्रश्न कैसे होता क्योंकि पित्तकी शान्ति चाहनेवालेको वैद्यके द्वारा यह उपदेश दिया जानेपर कि मधुर और शीत पदार्थ सेवन करना चाहिये रोगोका यह प्रश्न नहीं बन सकता कि उन दोनोंमेंसे किसी एकको ही पित्तकी शान्तिका उपाय बतलाइये। यदि ऐसी कल्पना की जाय कि भगवान्द्वारा कहे हुए वचन न समझनेके कारण अर्जुनने प्रश्न किया है तो फिर भगवान्को प्रश्नके अनुरूप ही यह उत्तर देना चाहिये था कि मैंने तो ज्ञान और कर्मका समुच्चय बतलाया है तू ऐसा भ्रान्त क्यों हो रहा है परंतु प्रश्नसे विपरीत दूसरा ही उत्तर देना कि मैंने दो निष्ठाएँ पहले कही हैं ( उपर्युक्त कल्पनाके ) उपयुक्त नहीं है। इसके सिवा यदि केवल स्मार्तकर्मके साथ ही ज्ञानका समुच्चय माना जाय तो भी विभक्त वर्णन आदि सब उपयुक्त नहीं ठहरते। तथा ऐसा माननेसे युद्धरूप स्मार्तकर्म क्षत्रियका स्वधर्म है यह जाननेवाले अर्जुनका इस प्रकार उलाहना देना भी नहीं बन सकता कि तत् किं कर्मणि घोरे मां नियोजयसि। सुतरां यह सिद्ध हुआ कि गीताशास्त्रमें किञ्चिन्मात्र भी श्रौत या स्मार्त किसी भी कर्मके साथ आत्मज्ञानका समुच्चय कोई भी नहीं दिखा सकता। अज्ञानसे या आसक्ित आदि दोषोंसे कर्ममें लगे हुए जिस पुरुषको यज्ञसे दानसे या तपसे अन्तःकरण शुद्ध होकर परमार्थतत्त्वविषयक ऐसा ज्ञान प्राप्त हो जाता है कि यह सब एक ब्रह्म ही है और वह अकर्ता है। उसके कर्ममें कर्म और फल दोनों ही यद्यपि निवृत्त हो चुकते हैं तो भी लोकसंग्रहके लिये पहलेकी भाँति यत्नपूर्वक कर्मोंमें लगे रहनेवाले पुरुषका जो प्रवृत्तिरूप कर्म दिखलायी देता है वह वास्तवमें कर्म नहीं है जिससे कि ज्ञानके साथ उसका समुच्चय हो सके। जैसे भगवान् वासुदेवद्वारा किये हुए क्षात्रकर्मोंका मोक्षकी सिद्धिके लिये ज्ञानके साथ समुच्चय नहीं होता वैसे ही फलेच्छा और अहंकारके अभावकी समानता होनेके कारण ज्ञानीके कर्मोंका भी ( ज्ञानके साथ समुच्चय नहीं होता )। क्योंकि आत्मज्ञानी न तो ऐसा ही मानता है कि मैं करता हूँ और न उन कर्मोंका फल ही चाहता है। इसके सिवा जैसे कामसाधनरूप अग्निहोत्रादि कर्मोंका अनुष्ठान करने के लिये सकाम अग्निहोत्रादिमें लगे हुए स्वर्गादिकी कामनावाले अग्निहोत्रीकी कामना यदि आधा कर्म कर चुकनेपर नष्ट हो जाय और फिर भी उसके द्वारा वही अग्निहोत्रादि कर्म होता रहे तो भी वह काम्यकर्म नहीं होता ( वैसे ही ज्ञानीके कर्म भी कर्म नहीं हैं )। कुर्वन्नपि न लिप्यते न करोति न लिप्यते इत्यादि वचनोंसे भगवान् भी जगहजगह यही बात दिखलाते हैं।    इसके सिवा जो पूर्वैः पूर्वतरं कृतम् कर्मणैव हि संसिद्धिमास्थिता जनकादयः इत्यादि वचन हैं उनको विभागपूर्वक समझना चाहिये। पू0 वह किस प्रकार समझें उ0 यदि वे पूर्वमें होनेवाले जनकादि तत्त्ववेत्ता होकर भी लोकसंग्रहके लिये कर्मोंमें प्रवृत्त थे तब तो यह अर्थ समझना चाहिये कि गुण ही गुणोंमें बरत रहे हैं इस ज्ञानसे ही वे परम सिद्धिको प्राप्त हुए अर्थात् कर्मसंन्यासकी योग्यता प्राप्त होनेपर भी कर्मोंका त्याग नहीं किया कर्म करतेकरते ही परम सिद्धिको प्राप्त हो गये। यदि वे जनकादि तत्त्वज्ञानी नहीं थे तो ऐसी व्याख्या करनी चाहिये कि वे ईश्वरके समर्पण किये हुए साधनरूप कर्मोंद्वारा चित्तशुद्धिरूप सिद्धिको अथवा ज्ञानोत्पत्तिरूप सिद्धिको प्राप्त हुए। यही बात भगवान् कहेंगे कि ( योगी ) अन्तःकरणकी शुद्धिके लिये कर्म करते हैं। तथा स्वकर्मणा तमभ्यर्च्य सिद्धिं विन्दति मानवः ऐसा कहकर फिर उस सिद्धिप्राप्त पुरुषके लिये सिद्धिं प्राप्तो यथा ब्रह्म इत्यादि वचनोंसे ज्ञाननिष्ठा कहेंगे। सुतरां गीताशास्त्रमें निश्चय किया हुआ अर्थ यही है कि केवल तत्त्वज्ञानसे ही मुक्ित होती है कर्मसहित ज्ञानसे नहीं। जैसा यह भगवान्का अभिप्राय है वैसा ही प्रकरणके अनुसार विभागपूर्वक उनउन स्थानोंपर हम आगे दिखलायेंगे।",
          "English": "2.10 And here, the text commencing from 'But seeing the army of the Pandavas' (1.2) and ending with '(he) verily became silent, telling Him (Govinda), \"I shall not fight\"' is to be explained as revealing the cause of the origin of the defect in the from of sorrow, delusion, etc. [Delusion means want of discrimination. Etc. stands for the secondary manifestations of sorrow and delusion, as also ignorance which is the root cause of all these.] which are the sources of the cycles of births and deaths of creatures. Thus indeed, Ajuna's own sorrow and delusion, cuased by the ideas of affection, parting, etc., originating from the erroneous belief, 'I belong to these; they belong to me', with regard to kingdom [See note under verse 8.-Tr.], elders, sons, comrades, well-wishers (1.26), kinsmen (1.37), relatives (1.34) and friends, have been shown by him with the words, 'How can I (fight)৷৷.in battle (against) Bhisma' (4), etc. It is verily because his discriminating insight was overwhelmed by sorrow and delusion that, even though he had become engaged in battle out of his own accord as a duty of the Ksatriyas, he desisted from that war and chose to undertake other's duties like living on alms etc. It is thus that in the case of all creatures whose minds come under the sway of the defects of sorrow, delusion, etc. there verily follows, as a matter of course, abandoning their own duties and resorting to prohibited ones. Even when they engage in their own duties their actions with speech, mind, body, etc., are certainly motivated by hankering for rewards, and are accompanied by egoism. [Egoism consists in thinking that one is the agent of some work and the enjoyer of its reward.] Such being the case, the cycle of births and deaths characterized by passing through desireable and undesirable births, and meeting with happiness, sorrow, etc. [From virtuous deeds follow attainment of heaven and happiness. From unvirtuous, sinful deeds follow births as beasts and other lowly beings, and sorrow. From the performance of both virtuous and sinful deeds follows birth as a human being, with a mixture of happiness and sorrow.] from the accumulation of virtue and vice, continues unendingly. Thus, sorrow and delusion are therefore the sources of the cycles of births and deaths. And their cessation comes from nothing other than the knowledge of the Self which is preceded by the renunciation of all duties. Hence, wishing to impart that (knowledge of the Self) for favouring the whole world, Lord Vasudeva, making Arjuna the medium, said, 'You grieve for those who are not to be grieved for,' etc. As to that some (opponents) [According to A.G. the opponent is the Vrttikara who, in the opinion of A. Mahadeva Sastri, is none other than Bodhayana referred to in Sankaracarya's commentary on B.S. 1.1.11-19.-Tr.] say: Certainly, Liberation cannot be attained merely from continuance in the knowledge of the Self which is preceded by renunciation of all duties and is independent of any other factor. What then? The well-ascertained conclusion of the whole of the Gita is that Liberation is attained through Knowledge associated with rites and duties like Agnihotra etc. prescribed in the Vedas and the Smrtis. And as an indication of this point of view they ote (the verses): 'On the other hand, if you will not fight this righteous (battle)' (33); 'Your right is for action (rites and duties) alone' (47); 'Therefore you undertake action (rites and duties) itself' (4.15), etc. Even this objection should not be raised that Vedic rites and duties lead to sin since they involve injury etc.'. Objection: How? Opponent: The duties of the Ksatriyas, charaterized by war, do not lead to sin when undertaken as one's duty, even though they are extremely cruel since they involve violence against elders, brothers, sons and others. And from the Lord's declaration that when they are not performed, 'then, forsaking your own duty and fame, you will incur sin' (33), it stands out as (His) clearly stated foregone conclusion that one's own duties prescribed in such texts as, '(One shall perform Agnihotra) as long as one lives' etc., and actions which involve crutely to animals etc. are not sinful. Vedantin: That is wrong because of the assertion of the distinction between firm adherence (nistha) to Knowledge and to action, which are based on two (different) convictions (buddhi). The nature of the Self, the supreme Reality, determined by the Lord in the text beginning with 'Those who are not to be grieved for' (11) and running to the end of the verse, 'Even considering your own duty' (31), is called Sankhya. Sankhya-buddhi [Sankhya is that correct (samyak) knowledge of the Vedas which reveals (khyayate) the reality of the Self, the supreme Goal. The Reality under discussion, which is related to this sankhya by way of having been revealed by it, is Sankhya.] (Conviction about the Reality) is the conviction with regard to That (supreme Reality) arising from the ascertainment of the meaning of the context [Ascertainment৷৷.of the context, i.e., of the meaning of the verses starting from, 'Never is this One born, and never does It die,' etc. (20).] that the Self is not an agent because of the absence in It of the six kinds of changes, viz birth etc. [Birth, continuance, growth, transformation, decay and death.] Sankhyas are those men of Knowledge to whom that (conviction) becomes natural. Prior to the rise of this Conviction (Sankhya-buddhi), the ascertained [Ast. and A.G. omit this word 'ascertainment, nirupana'-Tr.] of the performance of the disciplines leading to Liberation which is based on a discrimination between virtue and vice, [And adoration of God]. and which presupposes the Self's difference from the body etc. and Its agentship and enjoyership is called Yoga. The conviction with regard to that (Yoga) is Yoga-buddhi. The performers of rites and duties, for whom this (conviction) is appropriate, are called yogis. Accordingly, the two distinct Convictions have been pointed out by the Lord in the verse, 'This wisdom (buddhi) has been imparted to you from the standpoint of Self-realization (Sankhya). But listen to this (wisdom) from the standpoint of (Karma-) yoga' (39). And of these two, the Lord will separately speak, with reference to the Sankhyas, of the firm adherence to the Yoga of Knowledge. [Here Yoga and Knowledge are identical. Yoga is that through which one gets connected, identified. with Brahman.] which is based on Sankya-buddhi, in, 'Two kinds of adherences were spoken of by Me in the form of the Vedas, in the days of yore.' [This portion is ascending to G1.Pr. and A.A.; Ast. omits this and otes exactly the first line of 3.3. By saying, 'in the form of the Vedas', the Lord indicates that the Vedas, which are really the knowledge inherent in God and issue out of Him, are identical with Himself.-Tr.] similarly, in, 'through the Yoga of Action for the yogis' (3.3), He will separately speak of the firm adherence to the Yoga [Here also Karma and Yoga are identical, and lead to Liberation by bringing about purity of heart which is followed by steadfastness in Knowledge.] of Karma which is based on Yoga-buddhi (Conviction about Yoga). Thus, the two kinds of steadfastness that based on the conviction about the nature of the Self, and that based on the conviction about rites and duties have been distinctly spoken of by the Lord Himself, who saw that the coexistence of Knowledge and rites and duties is not possible in the same person, they being based on the convictions of non-agentship and agentship, unity and diversity (respectively). As is this teaching about the distinction (of the two adherences), just so has it been revealed in the Satapatha Brahmana: 'Desiring this world (the Self) alone monks and Brahmanas renounce their homes' (cf. Br. 4.4.22). After thus enjoining renunciation of all rites and duties, it is said in continuation, 'What shall we acheive through childeren, we who have attained this Self, this world (result).' [The earlier otation implies an injuction (vidhi) for renunciation, and the second is an arthavada, or an emphasis on that injunction. Arthavada: A sentence which usually recommends a vidhi, or precept, by stating the good arising from its proper observance, and the evils arising from its omission; and also by adducing historical instances in its support.-V.S.A] Again, there itself it is said that, before accepting a wife a man is in his natural state [The state of ignorance owing to non-realization of Reality. Such a person is a Brahmacarin, who goes to a teacher for studying the Vedas]. And (then) after his eniries into rites and duties, [The Brahmacarin first studies the Vedas and then enires into their meaning. Leaving his teacher's house after completing his course, he becomes a house holder.] 'he' for the attainment of the three worlds [This world, the world of manes and heaven.-Tr.] 'desired' (see Br. 1.4.17) as their means a son and the two kinds of wealth consists of rites and duties that lead to the world of manes, and the divine wealth of acisition of vidya (meditation) which leads to heaven. In this way it is shown that rites and duties enjoined by the Vedas etc. are meant only for one who is unenlightened and is passessed of desire. And in the text, 'After renouncing they take to mendicancy' (see Br. 4.4.22), the injunction to renounce is only for one who desires the world that is the Self, and who is devoid of hankering (for anything else). Now, if the intention of the Lord were the combination of Knowledge with Vedic rites and duties, then this utterance (of the Lord) (3.3) about the distinction would have been illogical. Nor would Arjuna's estion, 'If it be Your opinion that wisdom (Knowledge) is superior to action (rites and duties)৷৷.,' etc. (3.1) be proper. If the Lord had not spoken earlier of the impossibility of the pursuit of Knowledge and rites and duties by the same person (at the same time), then how could Arjuna falsely impute to the Lord by saying, 'If it be your opinion that wisdom is superior to action৷৷৷৷' (of having spoken) what was not heard by him, viz the higher status of Knolwedge over rites and duties? Morevoer, if it be that the combination of Knowledge with rites and duties was spoken of for all, then it stands enjoined, ipso facto, on Arjuna as well. Therefore, if instruction had been given for practising both, then how could the estion about 'either of the two' arise as in, 'Tell me for certain one of these (action and renunciation) by which I may attain the highest Good' (3.2)? Indeed, when a physician tells a patient who has come for a cure of his biliousness that he should take things which are sweet and soothing, there can arise no such reest as, 'Tell me which one of these two is to be taken as a means to cure biliousness'! Again, if it be imagined that Arjuna put the estion because of his noncomprehension of the distinct meaning of what the Lord had said, even then the Lord ought to have answered in accordance with the estion: 'The combination of Knowledge with rites and duties was spoken of by Me. Why are you confused thus?' On the other hand, it was not proper to have answered, 'Two kinds of steadfastness were spoken of by Me it the days of yore,' in a way that was inconsistent and at variance with the estion. Nor even do all the statements about distinction etc. become logical if it were intended that Knowledge was to be combined with rites and duties enjoined by the Smrtis only. Besides, the accusation in the sentence, 'Why then do you urge me to horrible action' (3.1) becomes illogical on the part of Arjuna who knew that fighting was a Ksatriya's natural duty enjoined by the Smrtis. Therefore, it is not possible for anyone to show that in the scripture called the Gita there is any combination, even in the least, of Knowledge of the Self with rites and duties enjoined by the Srutis or the Smrtis. But in the case of a man who had engaged himself in rites and duties because of ignorance and defects like the attachment, and then got his mind purified through sacrifices, charities or austerities (see Br. 4.4.22), there arises the knowledge about the supreme Reality that all this is but One, and Brahman is not an agent (of any action). With regard to him, although there is a cessation of rites and duties as also of the need for them, yet, what may, appear as his diligent continuance, just as before, in those rites and duties for setting an example before people that is no action in which case it could have stood combined with Knowledge. Just as the actions of Lord Vasudeva, in the form of performance of the duty of a Ksatriya, do not get combined with Knowledge for the sake of achieving the human goal (Liberation), similar is the case with the man of Knowledge because of the absence of hankering for results and agentship. Indeed, a man who has realized the Truth does not thingk 'I am doing (this)' nor does he hanker after its result. Again, as for instance, person hankering after such desirable things as heaven etc. may light up a fire for performing such rites as Agnihotra etc. which are the mans to attain desirable things; [The Ast. reading is: Agnihotradi-karma-laksana-dharma-anusthanaya, for the performance of duties in the form of acts like Agnihotra etc.-Tr.] then, while he is still engaged in the performance of Agnihotra etc. as the means for the desirable things, the desire may get destroyed when the rite is half-done. He may nevertheless continue the performance of those very Agnihotra etc.; but those performance of those very Agnihotra etc.; but those Agnihotra etc. cannot be held to be for this personal gain. Accordingly does the Lord also show in various places that, 'even while perfroming actions,' he does not act, 'he does not become tainted' (5.7). As for the texts, '৷৷.as was performed earlier by the ancient ones' (4.15), 'For Janaka and others strove to attain Liberation through action itself' (3.20), they are to be understood analytically. Objection: How so? Vedantin: As to that, if Janaka and others of old remained engaged in activity even though they were knowers of Reality, they did so for preventing people from going astray, while remaining established in realization verily through the knowledge that 'the organs rest (act) on the objects of the organs' (3.28). The idea is this that, though the occasion for renunciation of activity did arise, they remained established in realization along with actions; they did not give up their rites and duties. On the other hand, if they were not knowers of Reality, then the explanation should be this; Through the discipline of dedicating rites and duties to God, Janaka and others remained established in perfection (samsiddhi) either in the form of purification of mind or rise of Knowledge. This very idea [The idea that rites and duties become the cause of Knowledge through the purification of the mind.] will be expressed by the Lord in, '(the yogis) undertake action for the purification of oneself (i.e. of the heart, or the mind)' (5.11). After having said, 'A human being achieves success by adoring Him through his own duties' [By performing one's own duty as enjoined by scriptures and dedicating their results to God, one's mind becomes purified. Then, through Gods grace one becomes fit for steadfastness in Knowledge. From that steadfatness follows Liberation. Therefore rites and duites do not directly lead to Liberation. (See Common. under 5.12) (18.46), He will again speak of the steadfastness in Knowledge of a person who has attained success, in the text, '(Understand৷৷.from Me৷৷.that process by which) one who has achieved success attains Brahman' (18.50). So, the definite conclusion in the Gita is that Liberation is attained only from the knowledge of Reality, and not from its combination with action. And by pointing out in the relevant contexts the (aforesaid) distinction, we shall show how this conclusion stands. That being so, Lord Vasudeva found that for Arjuna, whose mind was thus confused about what ought to be done [The ast. and A.A., have an additional word mithyajnanavatah, meaning 'who had false ignorance'.-Tr.] and who was sunk in a great ocean of sorrow, there could be no rescue other than through the knowledge of the Self. And desiring to rescue Arjuna from that, He said, '(You grieve for) those who are not to be grieved for,' etc. by way of introducing the knowledge of the Self. [In this Gita there are three distinct parts, each part consisting of six chapters. These three parts deal with the three words of the great Upanisadic saying, 'Tattvamasi, thou art That', with a view to finding out their real meanings. The first six chapters are concerned with the word tvam (thou); the following six chapters determine the meaning of the word tat (that); and the last six reveal the essential identity of tvam and tat. The disciplines necessary for realization this identity are stated in the relevant places.]"

Thus, has it been said by Sri Yamunacarya: 'The introduction to the Sastra was begun for the sake of Arjuna, whose mind was agitated by misplaced love and compassion and by the delusion that righteousness was unrighteousness, and who took refuge in Sri Krsna.' The Supreme Person spoke these words as if smiling, and looking at Arjuna, who was thus overcome by grief resulting from ignorance about the real nature of the body and the self, but was nevertheless speaking about duty as if he had an understanding that the self is distinct from the body, and while he (Arjuna), torn between contradictory ideas, had suddenly become inactive standing between the two armies that were getting ready to fight. Sri Krsna said, as if in ridicule, to Arjuna the words beginning with, 'There never was a time when I did not exist' (II. 12), and ending with 'I will release you from all sins; grieve not!' (XVIII. 66) - which have for their contents the real nature of the self, of the Supreme Self, and of the paths of work (Karma), knowledge (Jnana) and devotion (Bhakti) which constitute the means for attaining the highest spiritual fulfilment."

There is no reason for such grief for those who possess the knowledge of the nature of the body and the self. Those who know the exact truth will not grieve for those bodies from which life has departed and for those from whome the principle of life has not departed. They do not grieve for bodies or souls.

Therefore you do not know the nature of the body nor of the self which is distinct from the body and is eternal. Nor do you know of duties like war etc., which (as duty) constitute the means for the attainment of the self, nor of the fact that this war (which forms a duty in the present context), if fought without any selfish desire for results, is a means for the attainment of the knowledge of the true nature of the self. The implied meaning is this: This self, verily, is not dependent on the body for Its existence, nor is It subjected to destruction on the death of the body, as there is no birth or death for It. Therefore there is no cause for grief. But the body is insentient by nature, is subject to change, and its birth and death are natural; thus it (body) too is not to be grieved for.

          "English": "2.12 Indeed, I, the Lord of all, who is eternal, was never non-existent, but existed always. It is not that these selves like you, who are subject to My Lordship, did not exist; you have always existed. It is not that 'all of us', I and you, shall cease to be 'in the future', i.e., beyond the present time; we shall always exist. Even as no doubt can be entertainted that I, the Supreme Self and Lord of all, am eternal, likewise, you (Arjuna and all others) who are embodied selves, also should be considered eternal. The foregoing implies that the difference between the Lord, the sovereign over all, and the individual selves, as also the differences among the individual selves themselves, are real. This has been declared by the Lord Himself. For, different terms like 'I', 'you', 'these', 'all' and 'we' have been used by the Lord while explaining the truth of eternality in order to remove the misunderstanding of Arjuna who is deluded by ignorance. [Now follows a refutation of the Upadhi theory of Bhaskara and the Ignorance theory of the Advaitins which deny any ultimate difference between the Lord and the Jivas.] If we examine (Bhaskara's) theory of Upadhis (adjuncts), which states that the apparent differences among Jivas are due to adjuncts, it will have to be admitted that mention about differences is out of place when explaining the ultimate truth, because the theory holds that there are no such differences in reality. But that the differences mentioned by the Lord are natural, is taught by the Sruti also: 'Eternal among eternals, sentient among sentients, the one, who fulfils the desires of the many' (Sve. U. VI. 13, Ka. U. V. 13). The meaning of the text is: Among the eternal sentient beings who are countless, He, who is the Supreme Spirit, fulfils the desires of all.' As regards the theory of the Advaitins that the perception of difference is brought about by ignorance only and is not really real, the Supreme Being - whose vision must be true and who, therefore must have an immediate cognition of the differencelss and immutable and eternal consciousness as constituting the nature of the Atman in all authenticity, and who must thery be always free from all ignorance and its effects - cannot possibly perceive the so-called difference arising from ignornace. It is, therefore, unimaginable that He engages himself in activities such as teaching, which can proceed only from such a perception of differences arising from ignorance. The argument that the Supreme Being, though possessed of the understanding of nom-duality, can still have the awareness of such difference persisting even after sublation, just as a piece of cloth may have been burnt up and yet continues to have the appearance of cloth, and that such a continuance of the subltated does not cause bondage - such an argument is invalid in the light of another analogy of a similar kind, namely, the perception of the mirage, which, when understood to be what it is, does not make one endeavour to fetch water therefrom. In the same way even if the impression of difference negated by the non-dualistic illumination persists, it cannot impel one to activities such as teaching; for the object to whom the instruction is to be imparted is discovered to be unreal. The idea is that just as the discovery of the non-existence of water in a mirage stops all effort to get water from it, so also when all duality is sublated by illumination, no activity like teaching disciples etc., can take place. Nor can the Lord be conceived as having been previously ignorant and as attaining knowledge of unity through the scirptures, and as still being subject to the continuation of the stultified experiences. Such a position would stand in contradiction to the Sruti and the Smrti: 'He, who is all-comprehender' (Mun. U., 1. 1. 9); all knower and supreme and natural power of varied types are spoken of in Srutis, such as knowledge, strength and action' (Sve. U. 6. 8); 'I know, Arjuna, all beings of the past, present and future but no one knows Me,' etc. (Gita 7. 26). And again, if the perception of difference and distinction are said to persist even after the unitary Self has been decisively understood, the estion will arise - to whom will the Lord and the succession of teachers of the tradition impart the knowledge in accordance with their understanding? The estion needs an answer. The idea is that knowledge of non-duality and perception of differences cannot co-exist. If it be replied by Advaitins holding the Bimba-Pratibimba (the original and reflections) theory that teachers give instructions to their own reflections in the form of disciples such as Arjuna, it would amount to an absurdity. For, no one who is not out of his senses would undertake to give any instruction to his own reflections in mediums such as a precious stone, the blade of a sword or a mirror, knowing, as he does, that they are non-different from himself. The theory of the persistence of the sublated is thus impossible to maintain, as the knowledge of the unitary self destroys the beginningless ignorance in which differences falling outside the self are supposed to be rooted. 'The persistence of the sublated' does occur in cases such as the vision of the two moons, where the cause of the vision is the result of some real defect in eyesight, nor removable by the right understanding of the singleness of the moon. Even though the perception of the two moons may continue, the sublated cognition is rendered inconseential on the strength of strong contrary evidence. For, it will not lead to any activity appropriate for a real experience. But in the present context (i.e. the Advaitic), the conception of difference, whose object and cause are admittedly unreal, is cancelled by the knowledge of reality. So the 'persistence of the sublated' can in no way happen. Thus, if the Supreme Lord and the present succession of preceptors have attained the understanding of (Non-dual) reality, their perception of difference and work such as teaching proceeding from that perception, are impossible. If, on the other hand, the perception of difference persists because of the continuance of ignorance and its cause, then these teachers are themselves ignorant of the truth, and they will be incapable of teaching the truth. Further, as the preceptor has attained the knowledge of the unitary self and thery the ignorance concerning Brahman and all the effects of such ignorance are thus annihilated, there is no purpose in instructing the disciple. It it is held that the preceptor and his knowledge are just in the imagination of the disciple, the disciple and his knowledge are similarly the product of the imagination of the preceptor, and as such can not put an end to the ignorance in estion. If it is maintained that the disciple's knowledge destroys ignorance etc., because it contradicts the antecedent state of non-enlightenment, the same can be asserted of the preceptor's knowledge. The futility of such teachings is obvious. Enough of these unsound doctrines which have all been refuted."

The contact with these through the ear and other senses gives rise to feelings of pleasure and pain, in the form of heat and cold, softness and hardness. The words 'cold and heat' illustrate other sensations too. Endure these with courage till you have discharged your duties as prescribed by the scriptures. The brave must endure them patiently, as they 'come and go'. They are transient. When the Karmas, which cause bondage, are destroyed, this 'coming and going' will end. The Lord now explains the purpose of this endurance:"

          "English": "2.16 Since 'the unreal has no being,' etc., for this reason also it is proper to bear cold, heat, etc. without becoming sorrowful or deluded. Asatah, of the unreal, of cold, heat, etc. together with their causes; na vidyate, there is no; bhavah, being, existence, reality; because heat, cold, etc. together with their causes are not substantially real when tested by means of proof. For they are changeful, and whatever is changeful is inconstant. As configurations like pot etc. are unreal since they are not perceived to be different from earth when tested by the eyes, so also are all changeful things unreal because they are not perceived to be different from their (material) causes, and also because they are not perceived before (their) origination and after destruction. Objection: If it be that [Here Ast. has the additional words 'karyasya ghatadeh, the effect, viz pot etc. (and)'.-Tr.] such (material) causes as earth etc. as also their causes are unreal since they are not perceived differently from their causes, in that case, may it not be urged that owing to the nonexistence of those (causes) there will arise the contingency of everything becoming unreal [An entity cannot be said to be unreal merely because it is non-different from its cause. Were it to be asserted as being unreal, then the cause also should be unreal, because there is no entity which is not subject to the law of cuase and effect.]? Vedantin: No, for in all cases there is the experience of two awarenesses, viz the awareness of reality, and the awareness of unreality. [In all cases of perception two awarenesses are involved: one is invariable, and the other is variable. Since the variable is imagined on the invariable, therefore it is proved that there is something which is the substratum of all imagination, and which is neither a cause nor an effect.] That in relation to which the awareness does not change is real; that in relation to which it changes is unreal. Thus, since the distinction between the real and the unreal is dependent on awareness, therefore in all cases (of empirical experiences) everyone has two kinds of awarenesses with regard to the same substratum: (As for instance, the experiences) 'The pot is real', 'The cloth is real', 'The elephant is real' (which experiences) are not like (that of) 'A blue lotus'. [In the empirical experience, 'A blue lotus', there are two awarenesses concerned with two entities, viz the substance (lotus) and the ality (blueness). In the case of the experience, 'The pot is real', etc. the awarenesses are not concerned with substratum and alities, but the awareness of pot,of cloth, etc. are superimposed on the awareness of 'reality', like that of 'water' in a mirage.] This is how it happens everywhere. [The coexistence of 'reality' and 'pot' etc. are valid only empirically according to the non-dualists; whereas the coexistence of 'blueness' and 'lotus' is real according to the dualists.] Of these two awareness, the awareness of pot etc. is inconstant; and thus has it been shown above. But the awareness of reality is not (inconstant). Therefore the object of the awareness of pot etc. is unreal because of inconstancy; but not so the object of the awareness of reality, because of its constancy. Objection: If it be argued that, since the awareness of pot also changes when the pot is destroyed, therefore the awareness of the pot's reality is also changeful? Vedantin: No, because in cloth etc. the awareness of reality is seen to persist. That awareness relates to the odjective (and not to the noun 'pot'). For this reason also it is not destroyed. [This last sentence has been cited in the f.n. of A.A.-Tr.] Objection: If it be argued that like the awareness of reality, the awareness of a pot also persists in other pots? Vedantin: No, because that (awareness of pot) is not present in (the awareness of) a cloth etc. Objection: May it not be that even the awareness of reality is not present in relation to a pot that has been destroyed? Vedantin: No, because the noun is absent (there). Since the awareness of reality corresponds to the adjective (i.e. it is used adjectivelly), therefore, when the noun is missing there is no possibility of its (that awareness) being an adjective. So, to what should it relate? But, again, the awareness of reality (does not cease) with the absence of an object৷৷ [Even when a pot is absent and the awareness of reality does not arise with regare to it, the awareness of reality persists in the region where the pot had existed. Some read nanu in place of na tu ('But, again'). In that case, the first portion (No,৷৷.since৷৷.adjective. So,৷৷.relate?) is a statement of the Vedantin, and the Objection starts from nanu punah sadbuddheh, etc. so, the next Objection will run thus: 'May it not be said that, when nouns like pot etc. are absent, the awareness of existence has no noun to alify, and therefore it becomes impossible for it (the awareness of existence) to exist in the same substratum?'-Tr.] Objection: May it not be said that, when nouns like pot etc. are absent, (the awareness of existence has no noun to alify and therefore) it becomes impossible for it to exist in the same substratum? [The relationship of an adjective and a noun is seen between two real entities. Therefore, if the relationship between 'pot' and 'reality' be the same as between a noun and an adjective, then both of them will be real entities. So, the coexistence of reality with a non-pot does not stand to reason.] Vedantin: No, because in such experiences as, 'This water exists', (which arises on seeing a mirage etc.) it is observed that there is a coexistence of two objects though one of them is non-existent. Therefore, asatah, of the unreal, viz body etc. and the dualities (heat, cold, etc.), together with their causes; na vidyate, there is no; bhavah, being. And similarly, satah, of the real, of the Self; na vidyate, there is no; abhavah, nonexistence, because It is constant everywhere. This is what we have said. Tu, but; antah, the nature, the conclusion (regarding the nature of the real and the unreal) that the Real is verily real, and the unreal is verily unreal; ubhayoh api, of both these indeed, of the Self and the non-Self, of the Real and the unreal, as explained above; drstah, has been realized thus; tattva-darsibhih, by the seers of Truth. Tat is a pronoun (Sarvanama, lit. name of all) which can be used with regard to all. And all is Brahman. And Its name is tat. The abstraction of tat is tattva, the true nature of Brahman. Those who are apt to realize this are tattva-darsinah, seers of Truth. Therefore, you too, by adopting the vision of the men of realization and giving up sorrow and delusion, forbear the dualities, heat, cold, etc. some of which are definite in their nature, and others inconstant , mentally being convinced that this (phenomenal world) is changeful, verily unreal and appears falsely like water in a mirage. This is the idea. What, again, is that reality which remains verily as the Real and surely for ever? This is being answered in, 'But know That', etc."

          "English": "2.16 'The unreal,' that is, the body, can never come into being. 'The real,' that is, the self, can never cease to be. The finale about these, the body and the self, which can be experienced, has been realised correctly by the seers of the Truth. As analyis ends in conclusion, the term 'finale' is here used. The meaning is this: Non-existence (i.e., perishableness) is the real nature of the body which is in itself insentient. Existence (i.e., imperishableness) is the real nature of the self, which is sentient. [What follows is the justification of describing the body as 'unreal' and as having 'never come into being.'] Non-existence has, indeed, the nature of perishableness, and existence has the nature of imperishableness, as Bhagavan Parasara has said: 'O Brahmana, apart from conscious entity there does not exist any group of things anywhere and at any time. Thus have I taught you what is real existence - how conscious entity is real, and all else is unreal' (V. P., 2.12.43 - 45). 'The Supreme Reality is considered as imperishable by the wise. There is no doubt that what can be obtained from a perishable substance is also perishable' (Ibid., 2.14.24). 'That entity which even by a change in time cannot come to possess a difference through modification etc., is real. What is that entity, O King? (It is the self who retains Its knowledge)' (Ibid., 2.13.100). It is said here also: 'These bodies ৷৷. are said to have an end' (2.18) and 'Know That (the Atman) to be indestructible' (2.17). It is seen from this that this (i.e., perishableness of the body and imperishableness of the self) is the reason for the designating the Atman as 'existence' (Sattva) and body as 'non-existence' (Asvattva). This verse has no reference to the doctrine of Satkaryavada (i.e., the theory that effects are present in the cause), as such a theory has no relevance here. Arjuna is deluded about the true nature of the body and the self; so what ought to be taught to him in order to remove his delusion, is discrimination between these two - what is alified by perishablenss and what, by imperishableness. This (declaration) is introduced in the following way: 'For the dead, or for the living' (2.11). Again this poin is made clear immediately (by the words), 'Know that to be indestructible ৷৷.' (2.17) and 'These bodies ৷৷. are said to have an end' (2.18). How the imperishableness of the self is to be understood, Sri Krsna now teaches:"

Otherwise, the everlastingness of the Self would be like that of the earth etc. Therefore, in order that this contingency may not arise, it is said, 'Of the everlasting, indestructible'. Aprameyasya, of the indeterminable, means 'of that which cannot be determined by such means of knowledge as direct perception etc.' Objection: Is it not that the Self is determined by the scriptures, and before that through direct perception etc.? Vedantin: No, because the Self is self-evident. For, (only) when the Self stands predetermined as the knower, there is a search for a means of knolwedge by the knower. Indeed, it is not that without first determining oneself as, 'I am such', one takes up the task of determining an object of knowledge. For what is called the 'self' does not remain unknown to anyone. But the scripture is the final authority [when the Vedic text establishes Brahman as the innermost Self, all the distinctions such as knower, known and the means of knowledge become sublated. Thus it is reasonable that the Vedic text should be the final authority. Besides, its authority is derived from its being faultless in as much as it has not originated from any human being.]: By way of merely negating superimposition of alities that do not belong to the Self, it attains authoritativeness with regard to the Self, but not by virtue of making some unknown thing known. There is an Upanisadic text in support of this: '৷৷.the Brahman that is immediate and direct, the Self that is within all' (Br. 3.4.1). Since the Self is thus eternal and unchanging, tasmat, therefore; yudhyasva, you join the battle, i.e. do not desist from the war. Here there is no injunction to take up war as a duty, because be (Arjuna), though he was determined for war, remains silent as a result of being overpowered by sorrow and delusion. Therefore, all that is being done by the Lord is the removal of the obstruction to his duty. 'Therefore, join the battle' is only an approval, not an injunction. The scripture Gita is intended for eradicating sorrow, delusion, etc. which are the cases of the cycle of births and deaths; it is not intended to enjoin action. As evidences of this idea the Lord cites two Vedic verses: [Ka. 1.2.19-20. There are slight verbal differences.-Tr.]"

          "English": "2.18 The root 'dih' means 'to grow.' Hence these bodies (Dehas) are characterised by complexity. They have an end - their nature is perishablity. For, jugs and such other things which are characterised by complexity are seen to have an end. The bodies of the embodied self, which are made of conglomerated elements, serve the purpose of experiencing the effects of Karmas, as stated in Brh. U. IV. 4.5, 'Auspicious embodiments are got through good actions.' Such bodies perish when Karmas are exhausted. Further the self is imperishable. Why? Because it is not measurable. Neither can It be conceived as the object of knowledge, but only as the subject (knower). It will be taught later on: 'He who knows It is called the knower of the Field by those who know this (13.1). Besides, the self is not seen to be made up of many (elements). Because in the perception 'I am the knower' throughout the body, only something other than the body is understood as possessing an invariable form as the knower. Further, this knower cannot be dismembered and seen in different places as is the case with the body. Therefore the self is eternal, for (1) It is not a complex being of a single form; (2) It is the knowing subject; and (3) It pervades all. On the contrary, the body is perishable, because (1) it is complex; (2) it serves the purpose of experiencing the fruits of Karma by the embodied self; (3) it has a plurality of parts and (4) it can be pervaded. Therefore, as the body is by nature perishable and the self by nature is eternal, both are not objects fit for grief. Hence, bearing with courage the inevitable strike of weapons, sharp or hard, liable to be received by you and others, begin the action called war without being attached to the fruits but for the sake of attaining immortality."

          "English": "2.20 Na kadacit, neverl; is ayam, this One; jayate, born i.e. the Self has no change in the form of being born to which matter is subject ; va, and ( va is used in the sense of and); na mriyate, It never dies. By this is denied the final change in the form of destruction. The word (na) kadacit), never, is connected with the denial of all kinds of changes thus never, is It born never does It die, and so on. Since ayam, this Self; bhutva, having come to exist, having experienced the process of origination; na, will not; bhuyah, again; abhavita, cease to be thereafter, therefore It does not die. For, in common parlance, that which ceases to exist after coming into being is said to die. From the use of the word va, nor, and na, it is understood that, unlike the body, this Self does not again come into existence after having been non-existent. Therefore It is not born. For, the words, 'It is born', are used with regard to something which comes into existence after having been non-existent. The Self is not like this. Therfore It is not born. Since this is so, therefore It is ajah, birthless; and since It does not die, therefore It is nityah, eternal. Although all changes become negated by the denial of the first and the last kinds of changes, still changes occuring in the middle [For the six kinds of changes see note under verse 2.10.-Tr.] should be denied with their own respective terms by which they are implied. Therefore the text says sasvatah, undecaying,. so that all the changes, viz youth etc., which have not been mentioned may become negated. The change in the form of decay is denied by the word sasvata, that which lasts for ever. In Its own nature It does not decay because It is free from parts. And again, since it is without alities, there is no degeneration owing to the decay of any ality. Change in the form of growth, which is opposed to decay, is also denied by the word puranah, ancient. A thing that grows by the addition of some parts is said to increase and is also said to be new. But this Self was fresh even in the past due to Its partlessness. Thus It is puranah, i.e. It does not grow. So also, na hanyate, It is puranah, i.e. It does not grow. So also, na hanyate, It is not killed, It does not get transformed; even when sarire, the body; hanyamane, is killed, transformed. The verb 'to kill' has to be understood here in the sense of transformation, so that a tautology [This verse has already mentioned 'death' in the first line. If the verb han, to kill, is also taken in the sense of killing, then a tautology is unavoidable.-Tr.] may be avoided. In this mantra the six kinds of transformations, the material changes seen in the world, are denied in the Self. The meaning of the sentence is that the Self is devoid of all kinds of changes. Since this is so, therefore 'both of them do not know' this is how the present mantra is connected to the earlier mantra."

The statement 'Having come into being once, It never ceases to be' means that this self, having emerged at the beginning of a Kalpa (one aeon of manifestation) will not cease to be at the end of the Kalpa (i.e., will emerge again at the beginning of the next Kalpa unless It is liberated). This is the meaning - that birth at the beginning of a Kalpa in bodies such as those of Brahman and others, and death at the end of a Kalpa as stated in the scriptures, do not touch the self. Hence, the selves in all bodies, are unborn, and therefore eternal. It is abiding, not connected, like matter, with invisible modifications taking place.

बुद्धिवृत्ति और आत्माका भेदज्ञान न रहनेके कारण अविद्याके सम्बन्धसे बुद्धि आदि इन्द्रियोंद्वारा ग्रहण किये हुए शब्दादि विषयोंका ग्रहण करनेवाला मान लिया जाता है। ऐसे ही आत्मअनात्मविषयक विवेकज्ञानरूप जो बुद्धिवृत्ति है जिसे विद्या कहते हैं वह यद्यपि असत्रूप है तो भी उसके सम्बन्धसे वास्तव में जो अविकारी है ऐसा आत्मा ही विद्वान् कहा जाता है। ज्ञानीके लिये सभी कर्म असम्भव बतलाये हैं इस कारण भगवान्का यह निश्चय समझा जाता है कि शास्त्रद्वारा जिन कर्मोंका विधान किया गया है वे सब अज्ञानियोंके लिये ही विहित हैं। \\n पू O विद्या भी अज्ञानीके लिये ही विहित है क्योंकि जिसने विद्याको जान लिया उसके लिये पिसेको पीसनेकी भाँति विद्याका विधान व्यर्थ है। अतः अज्ञानीके लिये कर्म कहे गये हैं ज्ञानीके लिये नहीं इस प्रकार विभाग करना नहीं बन सकता। \\n उ O यह कहना ठीक नहीं क्योंकि कर्तव्यके भाव और अभावसे भिन्नता सिद्ध होती है अभिप्राय यह कि अग्निहोत्रादि कर्मोंका विधान करनेवाले विधिवाक्योंके अर्थको जान लेनेके बाद अनेक साधन और उपसंहारके सहित अमुक अग्निहोत्रादि कर्म अनुष्ठान करनेके योग्य है मैं कर्ता हूँ मेरा अमुक कर्तव्य है इस प्रकार जाननेवाले अज्ञानीके लिये जैसे कर्तव्य बना रहता है वैसे न जायते इत्यादि आत्मस्वरूपका विधान करनेवाले वाक्योंके अर्थको जान लेनेके बाद उस ज्ञानीके लिये कुछ कर्तव्य शेष नहीं रहता। क्योंकि ( ज्ञानीको ) मैं न कर्ता हूँ न भोक्ता हूँ इत्यादि जो आत्माके एकत्व और अकर्तृत्व आदिविषयक ज्ञान है इससे अतिरिक्त अन्य किसी प्रकारका भी ज्ञान नहीं होता। इस प्रकार यह ( ज्ञानी और अज्ञानीके कर्तव्यका ) विभाग सिद्ध होता है। जो अपनेको ऐसा समझता है कि मैं कर्ता हूँ उसकी यह बुद्धि अवश्य ही होगी कि मेरा अमुक कर्तव्य है उस बुद्धिकी अपेक्षासे वह कर्मोंका अधिकारी होता है इसीसे उसके लिये कर्म हैं। और उभौ तौ न विजानीतः इस वचनके अनुसार वही अज्ञानी है। क्योंकि पूर्वोक्त विशेषणोंद्वारा वर्णित ज्ञानीके लिये तो कथं स पुरुषः इस प्रकार कर्मोंका निषेध करनेवाले वचन हैं। सुतरां ( यह सिद्ध हुआ कि ) आत्माको निर्विकार जाननेवाले विशिष्ट विद्वान्का और मुमुक्षुका भी सर्वकर्मसंन्यासमें ही अधिकार है। इसीलिये भगवान् नारायण ज्ञानयोगेन सांख्यानां कर्मयोगेन योगिनाम् इस कथनसे सांख्ययोगी ज्ञानियों और कर्मी अज्ञानियोंका विभाग करके अलगअलग दो निष्ठा ग्रहण करवाते हैं। ऐसे ही अपने पुत्रसे भगवान् वेदव्यासजी कहते हैं कि ये दो मार्ग हैं इत्यादि तथा यह भी कहते हैं कि पहले क्रियामार्ग और पीछे संन्यास। इसी विभागको बारंबार भगवान् दिखलायेंगे। जैसे अहंकारसे मोहित हुआ अज्ञानी मैं कर्ता हूँ ऐसे मानता है तत्त्ववेत्ता मैं नहीं करता ऐसे मानता है तथा सब कर्मोंका मनसे त्यागकर रहता है इत्यादि। इस विषयमें कितने ही अपनेको पण्डित समझनेवाले कहते हैं कि जन्मादि छः भावविकारोंसे रहित निर्विकार अकर्ता एक आत्मा मैं ही हूँ ऐसा ज्ञान किसीको होता ही नहीं कि जिसके होनेसे सर्वकर्मोंके संन्यासका उपदेश किया जा सके। यह कहना ठीक नहीं। क्योंकि ( ऐसा मान लेनेसे ) न जायते इत्यादि शास्त्रका उपदेश व्यर्थ होगा। उनसे यह पूछना चाहिये कि जैसे शास्त्रोपदेशकी सामर्थ्यसे कर्म करनेवाले मनुष्यको धर्मके अस्तित्वका ज्ञान और देहान्तरकी प्राप्तिका ज्ञान होता है उसी तरह उसी पुरुषको शास्त्रसे आत्माकी विर्विकारता अकर्तृत्व और एकत्व आदिका विज्ञान क्यों नहीं हो सकता यदि वे कहें कि ( मनबुद्धि आदि ) करणोंसे आत्मा अगोचर है इस कारण ( उसका ज्ञान नहीं हो सकता )। तो यह कहना ठीक नहीं। क्योंकि मनके द्वारा उस आत्माको देखना चाहिये यह श्रुति है अतः शास्त्र और आचार्यके उपदेशद्वारा एवं शम दम आदि साधनोंद्वारा शुद्ध किया हुआ मन आत्मदर्शनमें करण ( साधन ) है। इस प्रकार उस ज्ञानप्राप्तिके विषयमें अनुमान और आगमप्रमाणोंके रहते हुए भी यह कहना कि ज्ञान नहीं होता साहसमात्र है। यह तो मान ही लेना चाहिये कि उत्पन्न हुआ ज्ञान अपनेसे विपरीत अज्ञानको अवश्य नष्ट कर देता है। वह अज्ञान मैं मारनेवाला हूँ मैं मारा गया हूँ ऐसे मारनेवाले दोनों नहीं जानते इन वचनोंद्वारा पहले दिखलाया ही था फिर यहाँ भी यह बात दिखायी गयी है कि आत्मामें हननक्रियाका कर्तृत्व कर्मत्व और हेतुकर्तृत्व अज्ञानजनति है। आत्मा निर्विकार होनेके कारण कर्तृत्व आदि भावोंका अविद्यामूलक होना सभी क्रियाओंमे समान है। क्योंकि विकारवान् ही ( स्वयं ) कर्ता ( बनकर ) अपने कर्मरूप दूसरेको कर्ममें नियुक्त करता है कि तू अमुक कर्म कर। सुतरां ज्ञानीका कर्मोंमें अधिकार नहीं है यह दिखानेके लिये भगवान् वेदाविनाशिनम् कथं स पुरुषः इत्यादि वाक्योंसे सभी क्रियाओंमें समान भावसे विद्वान्के कर्ता और प्रयोजक कर्ता होनेका प्रतिषेध करते हैं। ज्ञानीका अधिकार किसमें है यह तो ज्ञानयोगेन सांख्यानाम् इत्यादि वचनोंद्वारा पहले ही बतलाया जा चुका है वैसे ही फिर भी सर्वकर्माणि मनसा इत्यादि वाक्योंसे सर्व कर्मोंका संन्यास ( भगवान् ) कहेंगे। \\n पू O ( उक्त श्लोकमें ) मनसा यह शब्द है इसलिये मानसिक कर्मोंका ही त्याग बतलाया है शरीर और वाणीसम्बन्धी कर्मोंका नहीं। \\n उ O यह कहना ठीक नहीं। क्योंकि सर्व कर्मोंको छोड़कर इस प्रकार कर्मोंके साथ सर्व विशेषण है। \\n पू O यदि मनसम्बन्धी सर्व कर्मोंका त्याग मान लिया जाय तो \\n उ O ठीक नहीं। क्योंकि वाणी और शरीरकी क्रिया मनोव्यापारपूर्वक ही होती है। मनोव्यापारके अभावमें उनकी क्रिया बन नहीं सकती। \\n पू O शास्त्रविहित कायिकवाचिक कर्मोंके कारणरूप मानसिक कर्मोंके सिवा अन्य सब कर्मोंका मनसे संन्यास करना चाहिये यह मान लिया जाय तो \\n उ O ठीक नहीं। क्योंकि न करता हुआ और न करवाता हुआ यह विशेषण साथमें है ( इसलिये तीनों तरह कर्मोंका संन्यास सिद्ध होता है। ) \\n पू O यह भगवान्द्वारा कहा हुआ सर्व कर्मोंका संन्यास तो मुमूर्षु के लिये है जीते हुएके लिये नहीं यह माना जाय तो \\n उ O ठीक नहीं। क्योंकि ऐसा मान लेनेसे नौ द्वारवाले शरीररूप पुरमें आत्मा रहता है इस विशेषणकी उपयोगिता नहीं रहती। कारण जो सर्वकर्मसंन्यास करके मर चुका है उसका न करते हुए और न करवाते हुए उस शरीरमें रहना सम्भव नहीं। \\n पू O उक्त वाक्यमें शरीरमें कर्मोंको रखकर इस तरह सम्बन्ध है शरीरमें रहता है इस प्रकार सम्बन्ध नहीं है ऐसा मानें तो \\n उ O ठीक नहीं है। क्योंकि सभी जगह आत्माको निर्विकार माना गया

          "English": "2.21 In the mantra, 'He who thinks of this One as the killer,' having declared that (the Self) does not become the agent or the object of the actof killing, and then in the mantra, 'Never is this One born,' etc., having stated the reasons for (Its) changelessness, the Lord sums up the purport of what was declared above: He who knows this One as indestructible, etc. Yah, he who; veda, knows yah is to be thus connected with Veda ; enam, this One, possessing the characteristics stated in the earlier mantra; as avinasinam, indestructible, devoid of the final change of state; nityam, eternal, devoid of transformation; ajam, birthless; and avyayam, undecaying; katham, how, in what way; (and kam, whom;) does sah, that man of realization; purusah, the person who is himself an authority [i.e. above all injunctions and prohibitions. See 18.16.17.-Tr.]; hanti, kill, undertake the act of killing; or how ghatayati, does he cause (others) to be killed, (how does he) instigate a killer! The intention is to deny both (the acts) by saying, 'In no way does he kill any one, nor does he cause anyone to be killed', because an interrogative sense is absurd (here). Since the implication of the reason [The reason for the denial of killing etc. is the changelessness of the Self, and this reason holds good with regard to all actions of the man of realization.-Tr.], viz the immutability of the Self, [The A.A. omits 'viz the immutability of the Self'.-Tr.] is common (with regard to all actions), therefore the negation of all kinds of actions in the case of a man of realization is what the Lord conveys as the only purport of this context. But the denial of (the act of) killing has been cited by way of an example. Objection: By noticing what special reason for the impossibility of actions in the case of the man of realization does the Lord deny all actions (in his case) by saying, 'How can that person,' etc.? Vedantin: Has not the immutability of the Self been already stated as the reason [Some readings omit this word.-Tr.] , the specific ground for the impossibility of all actions? Objection: It is true that it has been stated; but that is not a specific ground, for the man of realization is different from the immutable Self. Indeed, may it not be argued that action does not become impossible for one who has known as unchanging stump of a tree?! Vedantin: No, because of man of Knowledge is one with the Self. Enlightenment does not belong to the aggregate of body and senses. Therefore, as the last laternative, the knower is the Immutable and is the Self which is not a part of the aggregate. Thus, action being impossible for that man of Knowledge, the denial in, 'How can that person৷৷.,' etc. is reasonable. As on account of the lack of knowledge of the distinction between the Self and the modifications of the intellect, the Self, though verily immutable, is imagined through ignorance to be the perceiver of objects like sound etc. presented by the intellect etc., in this very way, the Self, which in reality is immutable, is said to be the 'knower' because of Its association with the knowledge of the distinction between the Self and non-Self, which (knowledge) is a modification of the intellect [By buddhi-vrtti, modification of the intellect, is meant the transformation of the internal organ into the form of an extension upto an object, along with its past impressions, the senses concerned, etc., like the extension of the light of a lamp illuminating an object. Consciousness reflected on this transformation and remaining indistinguishable from that transformation revealing the object, is called objective knowledge. Thery, due to ignorance, the Self is imagined to be the perceiver because of Its connection with the vrtti, modification. (-A.G.) The process is elsewhere described as follows: The vrtti goes out through the sense-organ concerned, like the flash of a torchlight, and along with it goes the reflection of Consciousness. Both of them envelop the object, a pot for instance. The vrtti destroys the ignorance about the pot; and the reflection of Consciousness, becoming unified with only that portion of it which has been delimited by the pot, reveals the pot. In the case of knowledge of Brahman, it is admitted that the vrtti in the form, 'I am Brahman', does reach Brahman and destroys ignorance about Brahman, but it is not admitted that Brahman is revealed like a 'pot', for Brahman is self-effulgent.-Tr.] and is unreal by nature. From the statement that action is impossible for man of realization it is understood that the conclusion of the Lord is that, actions enjoined by the scriptures are prescribed for the unenlightened. Objection: Is not elightenment too enjoined for the ignorant? For, the injunction about enlightenment to one who has already achieved realization is useless, like grinding something that has already been ground! This being so, the distinction that rites and duties are enjoined for the unenlightened, and not for the enlightened one, does not stand to reason. Vedantin: No. There can reasonable be a distinction between the existence or nonexistence of a thing to be performed. As after the knowledge of the meaning of the injunction for rites like Agnihotra etc. their performance becomes bligatory on the unenlightened one who thinks, 'Agnihotra etc. has to be performed by collecting various accessories; I am the agent, and this is my duty', unlike this, nothing remains later on to be performed as a duty after knowing the meaning of the injunction about the nature of the Self from such texts as, 'Never is this One born,' etc. But apart from the rise of knowledge regarding the unity of the Self, his non-agency, etc., in the form, 'I am not the agent, I am not the enjoyer', etc., no other idea arises. Thus, this distinction can be maintained. Again, for anyone who knows himself as, 'I am the agent', there will necessarily arise the idea, 'This is my duty.' In relation to that he becomes eligible. In this way duties are (enjoined) [Ast. adds 'sambhavanti, become possible'.-Tr.] for him. And according to the text, 'both of them do not know' (19), he is an unenlightened man. And the text, 'How can that person,' etc. concerns the enlightened person distinguished above, becuase of the negation of action (in this text). Therefore, the enlightened person distinguished above, who has realized the immutable Self, and the seeker of Liberation are alified only for renunciation of all rites and duties. Therefore, indeed, the Lord Narayana, making a distinction between the enlightened man of Knowledge and the unenlightened man of rites and duties, makes them take up the two kinds of adherences in the text, 'through the Yoga of Knowledge for the men of realization; through the Yoga of Action for the yogis' (3.3). Similarly also, Vyasa said to his son, 'Now, there are these two paths,' etc. ['Now, there are these two paths on which the Vedas are based. They are thought of as the dharma characterized by engagement in duties, and that by renunciation of them' (Mbh. Sa. 241.6).-Tr.] So also (there is a Vedic text meaning): 'The path of rites and duties, indeed, is the earlier, and renunciation comes after that.' [Ast. says that this is not a otation, but only gives the purport of Tai, Ar. 10.62.12.-Tr.] The Lord will show again and again this very division: 'The unenlightened man who is deluded by egoism thinks thus: \"I am the doer\"; but the one who is a knower of the facts (about the varieties of the gunas) thinks, \"I do not act\"' (cf. 3.27,28). So also there is the text, '(The embodied man of selfcontrol,) having given up all actions mentally, continues (happily in the town of nine gates)' (5.13) etc. With regard to this some wiseacres say: In no person does arise the idea, 'I am the changeless, actionless Self, which is One and devoid of the six kinds of changes beginning with birth to which all things are subject', on the occurrence of which (idea alone) can renunciation of all actions be enjoined. That is not correct, because it will lead to the needlessness of such scriptural instructions as, 'Never is this One born,' etc. (20). They should be asked: As on the authority of scripural instructions there arises the knowledge of the existence of virtue and vice and the knowledge regarding an agent who gets associated with successive bodies, similarly, why should not there arise from the scriptures the knowledge of unchangeability, non-agentship, oneness, etc. of that very Self? Objection: If it be said that this is due to Its being beyond the scope of any means (of knowledge)? Vedantin: No, because the Sruti says, 'It is to be realized through the mind alone, (following the instruction of the teacher)' (Br. 4.4.19). The mind that is purified by the instructions of the scriptures and the teacher, control of the body and organs, etc. becomes the instrument for realizing the Self. Again, since there exist inference and scriptures for Its realization, it is mere bravado to say that Knowledge does not arise. And it has to be granted that when knowledge arises, it surely eliminates ignorance, its opposite. And that ignorance has been shown in, 'I am the killer', 'I am killed', and 'both of them do not know' (see 2.19). And here also it is shown that the idea of the Self being an agent, the object of an action, or an indirect agent, is the result of ignorance. Also, the Self being changeless, the fact that such agentship etc. are cuased by ignorance is a common factor in all actions without exception, because only that agent who is subject to change instigates someone else who is different from himself and can be acted on, saying, 'Do this.' Thus, with a view to pointing out the absence of fitness for rites and duties in the case of an enlightened person, the Lord [Ast, adds vasudeva after 'Lord'.-Tr.] says, 'He who knows this One as indestructible,' 'how can that person,' etc. thery denying this direct and indirect agentship of an enlightened person in respect of all actions without exception. As regards the estion, 'For what, again, is the man of enlightenment alified?', the answer has already been give earlier in, 'through the Yoga of Knowledge for the men of realization' (3.3). Similarly, the Lord will also speak of renunication of all actions in, 'having given up all actions mentally,' etc.(5.13). Objection: May it not be argued that from the expression, 'mentally', (it follows that) oral and bodily actions are not to be renounced? Vedantin: No, because of the categoric expression, 'all actions'. Objection: May it not be argued that 'all actions' relates only to those of the mind? Vedantin: No, because all oral and bodily actions are preceded by those of the mind, for those actions are impossible in the absence of mental activity. Objection: May it not be said that one has to mentally renounce all other activities except the mental functions which are the causes of scriptural rites and duties performed through speech and body? Vedantin: No, because it has been specifically expressed: 'without doing or causing (others) to do anything at all' (5.13). Objection: May it not be that this renunciation of all actions, as stated by the Lord, is with regard to a dying man, not one living? Vedantin: No, because (in that case) the specific statement, 'The embodied man৷৷.continues happily in the town of nine gates' (ibid.) will become illogical since it is not possible for a dead person, who neither acts nor makes others act, [The words 'akurvatah akarayatah, (of him) who neither acts nor makes others act', have been taken as a part of the Commentator's arguement. But A.G. points out that they can also form a part of the next Objection. In that, case, the translation of the Objection will be this: Can it not be that the construction of the sentence (under discussion) is Neither doing nor making others do, he rest by depositing (sannyasya, by renouncing) in the body', but not 'he rests in the body by renouncing৷৷.'?] to rest in that body after renouncing all actions. Objection: Can it not be that the construction of the sentence (under discussion) is, '(he rests) by depositing (sannyasya, by renouncing) in the body', (but) not 'he rests in the body by renouncing৷৷.'? Vedantin: No, because everywhere it is categorically asserted that the Self is changeless. Besides, the action of 'resting' reires a location, whereas renunciation is independent of this. The word nyasa preceded by sam here means 'renunciation', not 'depositing'. Therefore, according to this Scripture, viz the Gita, the man of realization is eligible for renunciation, alone, not for rites and duties. This we shall show in the relevant texts later on in the cotext of the knowledge of the Self. And now we shall speak of the matter on hand: As to that, the indestructibility [Indestructibility suggests unchangeability as well.] of the Self, has been postulated. What is it like? That is being said in, 'As after rejecting wornout clothes,' etc."

          "English": "2.27 For what has originated, destruction is certain - it is seen to be inevitable. Similarly what has perished will inevitably originate. How should this be understood - that there is origination for that (entity)which has perished? It is seen that an existing entity only can originate and not a non-existent one. Origination, annihilation etc., are merely particular states of an existent entity. Now thread etc., do really exist. When arranged in a particular way, they are called clothes etc. It is seen that even those who uphold the doctrine that the effect is a new entity (Asatkarya-vadins) will admit this much that no new entity over and above the particular arrangement of threads is seen. It is not tenable to hold that this is the coming into being of a new entity, since, by the process of manufacture there is only attainment of a new name and special functions. No new entity emerges. Origination, annihilation etc., are thus particular stages of an existent entity. With regard to an entity which has entered into a stage known as origination, its entry into the opposite condition is called annihilation. Of an evolving entity, a seqence of evolutionary stages is inevitable. For instance, clay becomes a lump, jug, a potsherd, and (finally) powder. Here, what is called annihilation is the attainment of a succeeding stage by an entity which existed previously in a preceding stage. And this annihilation itself is called birth in that stage. Thus, the seence called birth and annihilation being inevitable for an evolving entity, it is not worthy of you to grieve. Now Sri Krsna says that not even the slightest grief arising from seeing an entity passing from a previous existing stage to an opposite stage, is justifiable in regard to human beings etc."

Those which have unmanifestness (avyakta), invisibility, as their death (nidhana) are avyakta-nidhanani. The idea is that even after death they verily attain unmanifestedness. Accordingly has it been said: 'They emerged from invisibility, and have gone back to invisibility. They are not yours, nor are you theirs. What is this fruitless lamentation!' (Mbh. St. 2.13). Ka, what; paridevana, lamentation, or what prattle, can there be; tatra, with regard to them, i.e. with regard to beings which are objects of delusion, which are invisible, (become) visible, (and then) get destroyed!"

After thus saying that there is no cause for grief even according to the view which identifies the body with the self, Sri Krsna proceeds to say that it is hard to find one who can be said to have truly perceived the Atman or spoken about It or heard about It or gained a true conception of It by hearing.
