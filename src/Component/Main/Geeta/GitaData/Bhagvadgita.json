Then, having heard that great tumult, Arjuna and Sri Krsna the Lord of all lords, who was acting as the charioteer of Arjuna, sitting in their great chariot which was powerful enough to coner the three worlds; blew their divine conchs Srimad Pancajanya and Devadatta. Then, both Yudhisthira and Bhima blew their respective conchs separately. That tumult rent asunder the hearts of your sons, led by Duryodhana.

The sons of Dhrtarastra then thought, 'Our cause is almost lost now itself.' So said Sanjaya to Dhrtarastra who was longing for their victory. Sanjaya said to Dhrtarastra: Then, seeing the Kauravas, who were ready for battle, Arjuna, who had Hanuman, noted for his exploit of burning Lanka, as the emblem on his flag on his chariot, directed his charioteer Sri Krsna, the Supreme Lord-who is overcome by parental love for those who take shelter in Him who is the treasure-house of knowledge, power, lordship, energy, potency and splendour, whose sportive delight brings about the origin, sustentation and dissolution of the entire cosmos at His will, who is the Lord of the senses, who controls in all ways the senses inner and outer of all, superior and inferior - by saying, 'Station my chariot in an appropriate place in order that I may see exactly my enemies who are eager for battle.'"

He was grief-stricken within.

Thus, has it been said by Sri Yamunacarya: 'The introduction to the Sastra was begun for the sake of Arjuna, whose mind was agitated by misplaced love and compassion and by the delusion that righteousness was unrighteousness, and who took refuge in Sri Krsna.' The Supreme Person spoke these words as if smiling, and looking at Arjuna, who was thus overcome by grief resulting from ignorance about the real nature of the body and the self, but was nevertheless speaking about duty as if he had an understanding that the self is distinct from the body, and while he (Arjuna), torn between contradictory ideas, had suddenly become inactive standing between the two armies that were getting ready to fight. Sri Krsna said, as if in ridicule, to Arjuna the words beginning with, 'There never was a time when I did not exist' (II. 12), and ending with 'I will release you from all sins; grieve not!' (XVIII. 66) - which have for their contents the real nature of the self, of the Supreme Self, and of the paths of work (Karma), knowledge (Jnana) and devotion (Bhakti) which constitute the means for attaining the highest spiritual fulfilment."

आदि जो संसारके बीजभूत दोष है उनकी उत्पत्तिका कारण दिखलानेके लिये है। क्योंकि कथं भीष्ममहं संख्ये इत्यादि श्लोकोंद्वारा अर्जुनने इसी तरह राज्य गुरु पुत्र मित्र सुहृद स्वजन सम्बन्धी और बान्धवोंके विषयमें यह मेरे हैं मैं इनका हूँ इस प्रकार अज्ञानजनित स्नेहविच्छेद आदि कारणोंसे होनेवाले अपने शोक और मोह दिखाये हैं। यद्यपि ( वह अर्जुन ) स्वयं ही पहले क्षात्रधर्मरूप युद्धमें प्रवृत्त हुआ था तो भी शोकमोहके द्वारा विवेकविज्ञानके दब जानेपर ( वह ) उस युद्धसे रुक गया और भिक्षाद्वारा जीवननिर्वाह करना आदि दूसरोंके धर्मका आचरण करनेके लिये प्रवृत्त हो गया। इसी तरह शोकमोह आदि दोषोंसे जिनका चित्त घिरा हुआ हो ऐसे सभी प्राणियोंसे स्वधर्मका त्याग और निषिद्ध धर्मका सेवन स्वाभाविक ही होता है।    यदि वे स्वधर्मपालनमें लगे हुए हों तो भी उनके मन वाणी और शरीरादिकी प्रवृत्ति फलाकांक्षापूर्वक और अहंकारसहित ही होती है। ऐसा होनेसे पुण्यपाप दोनों बढ़ते रहनेके कारण अच्छेबुरे जन्म और सुखदुःखोंकी प्राप्तिरूप संसार निवृत्त नहीं हो पाता अतः शोक और मोह यह दोनों संसारके बीजरूप हैं। इन दोनोंकी निवृत्ति सर्वकर्मसंन्यासपूर्वक आत्मज्ञानके अतिरिक्त अन्य उपायसे नहीं हो सकती। अतः उसका ( आत्मज्ञानका ) उपदेश करने की इच्छावाले भगवान् वासुदेव सब लोगोंपर अनुग्रह करने के लिये अर्जुनको निमित्त बनाकर कहने लगे अशोच्यान् इत्यादि। इसपर कितने ही टीकाकार कहते हैं कि केवल सर्वकर्मसंन्यासपूर्वक आत्मज्ञाननिष्ठामात्रसे ही कैवल्यकी ( मोक्षकी ) प्राप्ति नहीं हो सकती किंतु अग्निहोत्रादि श्रौतस्मार्तकर्मोंसहित ज्ञानसे मोक्षकी प्राप्ति होती है यही सारी गीताका निश्चित अभिप्राय है। इस अर्थमें वे प्रमाण भी बतलाते हैं जैसे अथ चेत्त्वमिमं धम्यं सङ्ग्रामं न करिष्यसि कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते कुरु कर्मैव तस्मात्त्वम् इत्यादि। ( वे यह भी कहते हैं कि ) हिंसा आदिसे युक्त होनेके कारण वैदिक कर्म अधर्मका कारण है ऐसी शंका भी नहीं करनी चाहिये क्योंकि गुरु भ्राता और पुत्रादिकी हिंसा ही जिसका स्वरूप है ऐसा अत्यन्त क्रूर युद्धरूप क्षात्रकर्म भी स्वधर्म माना जानेके कारण अधर्मका हेतु नहीं है ऐसा कहनेवाले तथा उसके न करनेमें ततः स्वधर्म कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि इस प्रकार दोष बतलानेवाले भगवान्का यह कथन तो पहले ही सुनिश्चित हो जाता है कि जीवनपर्यन्त कर्म करें इत्यादि श्रुतिवाक्योंद्वारा वर्णित पशु आदिकी हिंसारूप कर्मोंको करना अधर्म नहीं है। परंतु वह ( उन लोगोंका कहना ) ठीक नहीं है क्योंकि भिन्नभिन्न दो बुद्धियोंके आश्रित रहनेवाली ज्ञाननिष्ठा और कर्मनिष्ठाका अलगअलग वर्णन है। अशोच्यान् इस श्लोकसे लेकर स्वधर्ममपि चावेक्ष्य इस श्लोकके पहलेके प्रकरणसे भगवान्ने जिस परमार्थआत्मतत्त्वका निरूपण किया है वह सांख्य है तद्विषयक जो बुद्धि है अर्थात् आत्मामें जन्मादि छहों विकारोंका अभाव होनेके कारण आत्मा अकर्ता है इस प्रकारका जो निश्चय उक्त प्रकरणके अर्थका विवेचन करनेसे उत्पन्न होता है वह सांख्यबुद्धि है वह जिन ज्ञानियोंके लिये उचित होती है ( जो उसके अधिकारी हैं ) वे सांख्ययोगी हैं। इस ( उपर्युक्त ) बुद्धिके उत्पन्न होनेसे पहलेपहले आत्माका देहादिसे पृथक्पन कर्तापन और भोक्तापन माननेकी अपेक्षा रखनेवाला जो धर्मअधर्मके विवेकसे युक्त मार्ग है मोक्षसाधनोंका अनुष्ठान करनेके लिये चेष्टा करना ही जिसका स्वरूप है उसका नाम योग है और तद्विषयक जो बुद्धि है वह योगबुद्धि है वह जिन कर्मियोंके लिये उचित होती है ( जो उसके अधिकारी हैं ) वे योगी हैं। इसी प्रकार भगवान्ने एषा तेऽभिहिता सांख्ये बुद्धिर्योगे त्विमां श्रृणु इस श्लोकसे अलगअलग दो बुद्धियाँ दिखलायी हैं। उन दोनों बुद्धियोंमेंसे सांख्यबुद्धिके आश्रित रहनेवाली सांख्ययोगियोंकी ज्ञानयोगसे ( होनेवाली ) निष्ठाको पुरा वेदात्मना मया प्रोक्ता इत्यादि वचनोंसे अलग कहेंगे। तथा योगबुद्धिके आश्रित रहनेवाली कर्मयोगसे ( होनेवाली ) निष्ठाको कर्मयोगेन योगिनाम् इत्यादि वचनोंसे अलग कहेंगे। कर्तापनअकर्तापन और एकताअनेकताजैसी भिन्नभिन्न बुद्धिके आश्रित रहनेवाले जो ज्ञान और कर्म हैं उन दोनोंका एक पुरुषमें होना असम्भव माननेवाले भगवान्ने ही स्वयं उपर्युक्त प्रकारसे सांख्यबुद्धि और योगबुद्धिका आश्रय लेकर अलगअलग दो निष्टाएँ कही हैं। जिस प्रकार ( गीताशास्त्रमें ) इन दोनों निष्ठाओंका अलगअलग वर्णन है वैसे ही शतपथ ब्राह्मणमें भी दिखलाया गया है। ( वहाँ ) इस आत्मलोकको ही चाहनेवाले वैराग्यशील ब्राह्मण संन्यास लेते हैं इस प्रकार सर्वकर्मसंन्यासका विधान करके उसी वाक्यके शेष वाक्यसे कहा है कि जिन हमलोगोंका यह आत्मा ही लोक है ( वे हम ) सन्ततिसे क्या ( सिद्ध ) करेंगे। वहीं यह भी कहा है कि प्राकृत आत्मा अर्थात् अज्ञानी मनुष्य धर्मजिज्ञासाके बाद और विवाहसे पहले तीनों लोकोंकी प्राप्तिके साधनरूप पुत्रकी तथा दैव और मानुष ऐसे दो प्रकारके धनकी इच्छा करने लगा। इनमें पितृलोककी प्राप्तिका साधनरूप कर्म तो मानुष धन है और देवलोककी प्राप्तिका साधनरूप विद्या देवधन है। इस तरह ( उपर्युक्त श्रुतिमें ) अविद्या और कामनावाले पुरुषके लिये ही श्रौतादि सम्पूर्ण कर्म बताये गये हैं। उन सब ( कर्मों ) से निवृत्त होकर संन्यास ग्रहण करते हैं इस कथनसे केवल आत्मलोकको चाहनेवाले निष्कामी पुरुषके लिये संन्यासका ही विधान किया है। यदि ( इसपर भी यह बात मानी जायगी कि ) भगवान्को श्रौतकर्म और ज्ञानका समुच्चय इष्ट है तो यह उपर्युक्त विभक्त विवेचन अयोग्य ठहरेगा। तथा ( ऐसा मान लेनेसे ) ज्यायसी चेत्कर्मणस्ते इत्यादि जो अर्जुन का प्रश्न है वह भी नहीं बन सकता। यदि ज्ञान और कर्मका एक पुरुषद्वारा एक साथ किया जाना असम्भव और कर्मकी अपेक्षा ज्ञानका श्रेष्ठत्व भगवान्ने पहले न कहा होता तो इस तरह अर्जुन बिना सुनी हुई बातका झूठे ही भगवान्में अध्यारोप कैसे करता कि ज्यायसी चेत्कर्मणस्ते मता बुद्धिः। यदि सभीके लिये ज्ञान और कर्मका समुच्चय कहा होता तो अर्जुनके लिये भी वह कहा ही गया था फिर दोनोंका समुचित उपदेश होते हुए यच्छ्रेय एतयोरेकं तन्मे ब्रूहि सुनिश्चितम् इस प्रकार दोनोंमेंसे एकके ही सम्बन्धमें प्रश्न कैसे होता क्योंकि पित्तकी शान्ति चाहनेवालेको वैद्यके द्वारा यह उपदेश दिया जानेपर कि मधुर और शीत पदार्थ सेवन करना चाहिये रोगोका यह प्रश्न नहीं बन सकता कि उन दोनोंमेंसे किसी एकको ही पित्तकी शान्तिका उपाय बतलाइये। यदि ऐसी कल्पना की जाय कि भगवान्द्वारा कहे हुए वचन न समझनेके कारण अर्जुनने प्रश्न किया है तो फिर भगवान्को प्रश्नके अनुरूप ही यह उत्तर देना चाहिये था कि मैंने तो ज्ञान और कर्मका समुच्चय बतलाया है तू ऐसा भ्रान्त क्यों हो रहा है परंतु प्रश्नसे विपरीत दूसरा ही उत्तर देना कि मैंने दो निष्ठाएँ पहले कही हैं ( उपर्युक्त कल्पनाके ) उपयुक्त नहीं है। इसके सिवा यदि केवल स्मार्तकर्मके साथ ही ज्ञानका समुच्चय माना जाय तो भी विभक्त वर्णन आदि सब उपयुक्त नहीं ठहरते। तथा ऐसा माननेसे युद्धरूप स्मार्तकर्म क्षत्रियका स्वधर्म है यह जाननेवाले अर्जुनका इस प्रकार उलाहना देना भी नहीं बन सकता कि तत् किं कर्मणि घोरे मां नियोजयसि। सुतरां यह सिद्ध हुआ कि गीताशास्त्रमें किञ्चिन्मात्र भी श्रौत या स्मार्त किसी भी कर्मके साथ आत्मज्ञानका समुच्चय कोई भी नहीं दिखा सकता। अज्ञानसे या आसक्ित आदि दोषोंसे कर्ममें लगे हुए जिस पुरुषको यज्ञसे दानसे या तपसे अन्तःकरण शुद्ध होकर परमार्थतत्त्वविषयक ऐसा ज्ञान प्राप्त हो जाता है कि यह सब एक ब्रह्म ही है और वह अकर्ता है। उसके कर्ममें कर्म और फल दोनों ही यद्यपि निवृत्त हो चुकते हैं तो भी लोकसंग्रहके लिये पहलेकी भाँति यत्नपूर्वक कर्मोंमें लगे रहनेवाले पुरुषका जो प्रवृत्तिरूप कर्म दिखलायी देता है वह वास्तवमें कर्म नहीं है जिससे कि ज्ञानके साथ उसका समुच्चय हो सके। जैसे भगवान् वासुदेवद्वारा किये हुए क्षात्रकर्मोंका मोक्षकी सिद्धिके लिये ज्ञानके साथ समुच्चय नहीं होता वैसे ही फलेच्छा और अहंकारके अभावकी समानता होनेके कारण ज्ञानीके कर्मोंका भी ( ज्ञानके साथ समुच्चय नहीं होता )। क्योंकि आत्मज्ञानी न तो ऐसा ही मानता है कि मैं करता हूँ और न उन कर्मोंका फल ही चाहता है। इसके सिवा जैसे कामसाधनरूप अग्निहोत्रादि कर्मोंका अनुष्ठान करने के लिये सकाम अग्निहोत्रादिमें लगे हुए स्वर्गादिकी कामनावाले अग्निहोत्रीकी कामना यदि आधा कर्म कर चुकनेपर नष्ट हो जाय और फिर भी उसके द्वारा वही अग्निहोत्रादि कर्म होता रहे तो भी वह काम्यकर्म नहीं होता ( वैसे ही ज्ञानीके कर्म भी कर्म नहीं हैं )। कुर्वन्नपि न लिप्यते न करोति न लिप्यते इत्यादि वचनोंसे भगवान् भी जगहजगह यही बात दिखलाते हैं।    इसके सिवा जो पूर्वैः पूर्वतरं कृतम् कर्मणैव हि संसिद्धिमास्थिता जनकादयः इत्यादि वचन हैं उनको विभागपूर्वक समझना चाहिये। पू0 वह किस प्रकार समझें उ0 यदि वे पूर्वमें होनेवाले जनकादि तत्त्ववेत्ता होकर भी लोकसंग्रहके लिये कर्मोंमें प्रवृत्त थे तब तो यह अर्थ समझना चाहिये कि गुण ही गुणोंमें बरत रहे हैं इस ज्ञानसे ही वे परम सिद्धिको प्राप्त हुए अर्थात् कर्मसंन्यासकी योग्यता प्राप्त होनेपर भी कर्मोंका त्याग नहीं किया कर्म करतेकरते ही परम सिद्धिको प्राप्त हो गये। यदि वे जनकादि तत्त्वज्ञानी नहीं थे तो ऐसी व्याख्या करनी चाहिये कि वे ईश्वरके समर्पण किये हुए साधनरूप कर्मोंद्वारा चित्तशुद्धिरूप सिद्धिको अथवा ज्ञानोत्पत्तिरूप सिद्धिको प्राप्त हुए। यही बात भगवान् कहेंगे कि ( योगी ) अन्तःकरणकी शुद्धिके लिये कर्म करते हैं। तथा स्वकर्मणा तमभ्यर्च्य सिद्धिं विन्दति मानवः ऐसा कहकर फिर उस सिद्धिप्राप्त पुरुषके लिये सिद्धिं प्राप्तो यथा ब्रह्म इत्यादि वचनोंसे ज्ञाननिष्ठा कहेंगे। सुतरां गीताशास्त्रमें निश्चय किया हुआ अर्थ यही है कि केवल तत्त्वज्ञानसे ही मुक्ित होती है कर्मसहित ज्ञानसे नहीं। जैसा यह भगवान्का अभिप्राय है वैसा ही प्रकरणके अनुसार विभागपूर्वक उनउन स्थानोंपर हम आगे दिखलायेंगे।",
      "English": "2.10 And here, the text commencing from 'But seeing the army of the Pandavas' (1.2) and ending with '(he) verily became silent, telling Him (Govinda), \"I shall not fight\"' is to be explained as revealing the cause of the origin of the defect in the from of sorrow, delusion, etc. [Delusion means want of discrimination. Etc. stands for the secondary manifestations of sorrow and delusion, as also ignorance which is the root cause of all these.] which are the sources of the cycles of births and deaths of creatures. Thus indeed, Ajuna's own sorrow and delusion, cuased by the ideas of affection, parting, etc., originating from the erroneous belief, 'I belong to these; they belong to me', with regard to kingdom [See note under verse 8.-Tr.], elders, sons, comrades, well-wishers (1.26), kinsmen (1.37), relatives (1.34) and friends, have been shown by him with the words, 'How can I (fight)৷৷.in battle (against) Bhisma' (4), etc. It is verily because his discriminating insight was overwhelmed by sorrow and delusion that, even though he had become engaged in battle out of his own accord as a duty of the Ksatriyas, he desisted from that war and chose to undertake other's duties like living on alms etc. It is thus that in the case of all creatures whose minds come under the sway of the defects of sorrow, delusion, etc. there verily follows, as a matter of course, abandoning their own duties and resorting to prohibited ones. Even when they engage in their own duties their actions with speech, mind, body, etc., are certainly motivated by hankering for rewards, and are accompanied by egoism. [Egoism consists in thinking that one is the agent of some work and the enjoyer of its reward.] Such being the case, the cycle of births and deaths characterized by passing through desireable and undesirable births, and meeting with happiness, sorrow, etc. [From virtuous deeds follow attainment of heaven and happiness. From unvirtuous, sinful deeds follow births as beasts and other lowly beings, and sorrow. From the performance of both virtuous and sinful deeds follows birth as a human being, with a mixture of happiness and sorrow.] from the accumulation of virtue and vice, continues unendingly. Thus, sorrow and delusion are therefore the sources of the cycles of births and deaths. And their cessation comes from nothing other than the knowledge of the Self which is preceded by the renunciation of all duties. Hence, wishing to impart that (knowledge of the Self) for favouring the whole world, Lord Vasudeva, making Arjuna the medium, said, 'You grieve for those who are not to be grieved for,' etc. As to that some (opponents) [According to A.G. the opponent is the Vrttikara who, in the opinion of A. Mahadeva Sastri, is none other than Bodhayana referred to in Sankaracarya's commentary on B.S. 1.1.11-19.-Tr.] say: Certainly, Liberation cannot be attained merely from continuance in the knowledge of the Self which is preceded by renunciation of all duties and is independent of any other factor. What then? The well-ascertained conclusion of the whole of the Gita is that Liberation is attained through Knowledge associated with rites and duties like Agnihotra etc. prescribed in the Vedas and the Smrtis. And as an indication of this point of view they ote (the verses): 'On the other hand, if you will not fight this righteous (battle)' (33); 'Your right is for action (rites and duties) alone' (47); 'Therefore you undertake action (rites and duties) itself' (4.15), etc. Even this objection should not be raised that Vedic rites and duties lead to sin since they involve injury etc.'. Objection: How? Opponent: The duties of the Ksatriyas, charaterized by war, do not lead to sin when undertaken as one's duty, even though they are extremely cruel since they involve violence against elders, brothers, sons and others. And from the Lord's declaration that when they are not performed, 'then, forsaking your own duty and fame, you will incur sin' (33), it stands out as (His) clearly stated foregone conclusion that one's own duties prescribed in such texts as, '(One shall perform Agnihotra) as long as one lives' etc., and actions which involve crutely to animals etc. are not sinful. Vedantin: That is wrong because of the assertion of the distinction between firm adherence (nistha) to Knowledge and to action, which are based on two (different) convictions (buddhi). The nature of the Self, the supreme Reality, determined by the Lord in the text beginning with 'Those who are not to be grieved for' (11) and running to the end of the verse, 'Even considering your own duty' (31), is called Sankhya. Sankhya-buddhi [Sankhya is that correct (samyak) knowledge of the Vedas which reveals (khyayate) the reality of the Self, the supreme Goal. The Reality under discussion, which is related to this sankhya by way of having been revealed by it, is Sankhya.] (Conviction about the Reality) is the conviction with regard to That (supreme Reality) arising from the ascertainment of the meaning of the context [Ascertainment৷৷.of the context, i.e., of the meaning of the verses starting from, 'Never is this One born, and never does It die,' etc. (20).] that the Self is not an agent because of the absence in It of the six kinds of changes, viz birth etc. [Birth, continuance, growth, transformation, decay and death.] Sankhyas are those men of Knowledge to whom that (conviction) becomes natural. Prior to the rise of this Conviction (Sankhya-buddhi), the ascertained [Ast. and A.G. omit this word 'ascertainment, nirupana'-Tr.] of the performance of the disciplines leading to Liberation which is based on a discrimination between virtue and vice, [And adoration of God]. and which presupposes the Self's difference from the body etc. and Its agentship and enjoyership is called Yoga. The conviction with regard to that (Yoga) is Yoga-buddhi. The performers of rites and duties, for whom this (conviction) is appropriate, are called yogis. Accordingly, the two distinct Convictions have been pointed out by the Lord in the verse, 'This wisdom (buddhi) has been imparted to you from the standpoint of Self-realization (Sankhya). But listen to this (wisdom) from the standpoint of (Karma-) yoga' (39). And of these two, the Lord will separately speak, with reference to the Sankhyas, of the firm adherence to the Yoga of Knowledge. [Here Yoga and Knowledge are identical. Yoga is that through which one gets connected, identified. with Brahman.] which is based on Sankya-buddhi, in, 'Two kinds of adherences were spoken of by Me in the form of the Vedas, in the days of yore.' [This portion is ascending to G1.Pr. and A.A.; Ast. omits this and otes exactly the first line of 3.3. By saying, 'in the form of the Vedas', the Lord indicates that the Vedas, which are really the knowledge inherent in God and issue out of Him, are identical with Himself.-Tr.] similarly, in, 'through the Yoga of Action for the yogis' (3.3), He will separately speak of the firm adherence to the Yoga [Here also Karma and Yoga are identical, and lead to Liberation by bringing about purity of heart which is followed by steadfastness in Knowledge.] of Karma which is based on Yoga-buddhi (Conviction about Yoga). Thus, the two kinds of steadfastness that based on the conviction about the nature of the Self, and that based on the conviction about rites and duties have been distinctly spoken of by the Lord Himself, who saw that the coexistence of Knowledge and rites and duties is not possible in the same person, they being based on the convictions of non-agentship and agentship, unity and diversity (respectively). As is this teaching about the distinction (of the two adherences), just so has it been revealed in the Satapatha Brahmana: 'Desiring this world (the Self) alone monks and Brahmanas renounce their homes' (cf. Br. 4.4.22). After thus enjoining renunciation of all rites and duties, it is said in continuation, 'What shall we acheive through childeren, we who have attained this Self, this world (result).' [The earlier otation implies an injuction (vidhi) for renunciation, and the second is an arthavada, or an emphasis on that injunction. Arthavada: A sentence which usually recommends a vidhi, or precept, by stating the good arising from its proper observance, and the evils arising from its omission; and also by adducing historical instances in its support.-V.S.A] Again, there itself it is said that, before accepting a wife a man is in his natural state [The state of ignorance owing to non-realization of Reality. Such a person is a Brahmacarin, who goes to a teacher for studying the Vedas]. And (then) after his eniries into rites and duties, [The Brahmacarin first studies the Vedas and then enires into their meaning. Leaving his teacher's house after completing his course, he becomes a house holder.] 'he' for the attainment of the three worlds [This world, the world of manes and heaven.-Tr.] 'desired' (see Br. 1.4.17) as their means a son and the two kinds of wealth consists of rites and duties that lead to the world of manes, and the divine wealth of acisition of vidya (meditation) which leads to heaven. In this way it is shown that rites and duties enjoined by the Vedas etc. are meant only for one who is unenlightened and is passessed of desire. And in the text, 'After renouncing they take to mendicancy' (see Br. 4.4.22), the injunction to renounce is only for one who desires the world that is the Self, and who is devoid of hankering (for anything else). Now, if the intention of the Lord were the combination of Knowledge with Vedic rites and duties, then this utterance (of the Lord) (3.3) about the distinction would have been illogical. Nor would Arjuna's estion, 'If it be Your opinion that wisdom (Knowledge) is superior to action (rites and duties)৷৷.,' etc. (3.1) be proper. If the Lord had not spoken earlier of the impossibility of the pursuit of Knowledge and rites and duties by the same person (at the same time), then how could Arjuna falsely impute to the Lord by saying, 'If it be your opinion that wisdom is superior to action৷৷৷৷' (of having spoken) what was not heard by him, viz the higher status of Knolwedge over rites and duties? Morevoer, if it be that the combination of Knowledge with rites and duties was spoken of for all, then it stands enjoined, ipso facto, on Arjuna as well. Therefore, if instruction had been given for practising both, then how could the estion about 'either of the two' arise as in, 'Tell me for certain one of these (action and renunciation) by which I may attain the highest Good' (3.2)? Indeed, when a physician tells a patient who has come for a cure of his biliousness that he should take things which are sweet and soothing, there can arise no such reest as, 'Tell me which one of these two is to be taken as a means to cure biliousness'! Again, if it be imagined that Arjuna put the estion because of his noncomprehension of the distinct meaning of what the Lord had said, even then the Lord ought to have answered in accordance with the estion: 'The combination of Knowledge with rites and duties was spoken of by Me. Why are you confused thus?' On the other hand, it was not proper to have answered, 'Two kinds of steadfastness were spoken of by Me it the days of yore,' in a way that was inconsistent and at variance with the estion. Nor even do all the statements about distinction etc. become logical if it were intended that Knowledge was to be combined with rites and duties enjoined by the Smrtis only. Besides, the accusation in the sentence, 'Why then do you urge me to horrible action' (3.1) becomes illogical on the part of Arjuna who knew that fighting was a Ksatriya's natural duty enjoined by the Smrtis. Therefore, it is not possible for anyone to show that in the scripture called the Gita there is any combination, even in the least, of Knowledge of the Self with rites and duties enjoined by the Srutis or the Smrtis. But in the case of a man who had engaged himself in rites and duties because of ignorance and defects like the attachment, and then got his mind purified through sacrifices, charities or austerities (see Br. 4.4.22), there arises the knowledge about the supreme Reality that all this is but One, and Brahman is not an agent (of any action). With regard to him, although there is a cessation of rites and duties as also of the need for them, yet, what may, appear as his diligent continuance, just as before, in those rites and duties for setting an example before people that is no action in which case it could have stood combined with Knowledge. Just as the actions of Lord Vasudeva, in the form of performance of the duty of a Ksatriya, do not get combined with Knowledge for the sake of achieving the human goal (Liberation), similar is the case with the man of Knowledge because of the absence of hankering for results and agentship. Indeed, a man who has realized the Truth does not thingk 'I am doing (this)' nor does he hanker after its result. Again, as for instance, person hankering after such desirable things as heaven etc. may light up a fire for performing such rites as Agnihotra etc. which are the mans to attain desirable things; [The Ast. reading is: Agnihotradi-karma-laksana-dharma-anusthanaya, for the performance of duties in the form of acts like Agnihotra etc.-Tr.] then, while he is still engaged in the performance of Agnihotra etc. as the means for the desirable things, the desire may get destroyed when the rite is half-done. He may nevertheless continue the performance of those very Agnihotra etc.; but those performance of those very Agnihotra etc.; but those Agnihotra etc. cannot be held to be for this personal gain. Accordingly does the Lord also show in various places that, 'even while perfroming actions,' he does not act, 'he does not become tainted' (5.7). As for the texts, '৷৷.as was performed earlier by the ancient ones' (4.15), 'For Janaka and others strove to attain Liberation through action itself' (3.20), they are to be understood analytically. Objection: How so? Vedantin: As to that, if Janaka and others of old remained engaged in activity even though they were knowers of Reality, they did so for preventing people from going astray, while remaining established in realization verily through the knowledge that 'the organs rest (act) on the objects of the organs' (3.28). The idea is this that, though the occasion for renunciation of activity did arise, they remained established in realization along with actions; they did not give up their rites and duties. On the other hand, if they were not knowers of Reality, then the explanation should be this; Through the discipline of dedicating rites and duties to God, Janaka and others remained established in perfection (samsiddhi) either in the form of purification of mind or rise of Knowledge. This very idea [The idea that rites and duties become the cause of Knowledge through the purification of the mind.] will be expressed by the Lord in, '(the yogis) undertake action for the purification of oneself (i.e. of the heart, or the mind)' (5.11). After having said, 'A human being achieves success by adoring Him through his own duties' [By performing one's own duty as enjoined by scriptures and dedicating their results to God, one's mind becomes purified. Then, through Gods grace one becomes fit for steadfastness in Knowledge. From that steadfatness follows Liberation. Therefore rites and duites do not directly lead to Liberation. (See Common. under 5.12) (18.46), He will again speak of the steadfastness in Knowledge of a person who has attained success, in the text, '(Understand৷৷.from Me৷৷.that process by which) one who has achieved success attains Brahman' (18.50). So, the definite conclusion in the Gita is that Liberation is attained only from the knowledge of Reality, and not from its combination with action. And by pointing out in the relevant contexts the (aforesaid) distinction, we shall show how this conclusion stands. That being so, Lord Vasudeva found that for Arjuna, whose mind was thus confused about what ought to be done [The ast. and A.A., have an additional word mithyajnanavatah, meaning 'who had false ignorance'.-Tr.] and who was sunk in a great ocean of sorrow, there could be no rescue other than through the knowledge of the Self. And desiring to rescue Arjuna from that, He said, '(You grieve for) those who are not to be grieved for,' etc. by way of introducing the knowledge of the Self. [In this Gita there are three distinct parts, each part consisting of six chapters. These three parts deal with the three words of the great Upanisadic saying, 'Tattvamasi, thou art That', with a view to finding out their real meanings. The first six chapters are concerned with the word tvam (thou); the following six chapters determine the meaning of the word tat (that); and the last six reveal the essential identity of tvam and tat. The disciplines necessary for realization this identity are stated in the relevant places.]"

      "English": "2.9 - 2.10 Sanjaya said Thus, the Lord, the Supreme Person, introduced the Sastra regarding the self for the sake of Arjuna - whose natural courage was lost due to love and compassion in a misplaced situation, who thought war to be unrighteous even though it was the highest duty for warriors (Ksatriyas), and who took refuge in Sri Krsna to know what his right duty was -, thinking that Arjuna's delusion would not come to an end except by the knowledge of the real nature of the self, and that war was an ordained duty here which, when freed from attachment to fruits, is a means for self-knowledge. Thus, has it been said by Sri Yamunacarya: 'The introduction to the Sastra was begun for the sake of Arjuna, whose mind was agitated by misplaced love and compassion and by the delusion that righteousness was unrighteousness, and who took refuge in Sri Krsna.' The Supreme Person spoke these words as if smiling, and looking at Arjuna, who was thus overcome by grief resulting from ignorance about the real nature of the body and the self, but was nevertheless speaking about duty as if he had an understanding that the self is distinct from the body, and while he (Arjuna), torn between contradictory ideas, had suddenly become inactive standing between the two armies that were getting ready to fight. Sri Krsna said, as if in ridicule, to Arjuna the words beginning with, 'There never was a time when I did not exist' (II. 12), and ending with 'I will release you from all sins; grieve not!' (XVIII. 66) - which have for their contents the real nature of the self, of the Supreme Self, and of the paths of work (Karma), knowledge (Jnana) and devotion (Bhakti) which constitute the means for attaining the highest spiritual fulfilment."

(Br. 3.5.1) ['Therefore the knowers of Brahman, having known all about scholorship, should try to live upon that strength which comes of Knowledge; having known all about this strength as well as scholorship, he becomes meditative; having known all about both meditativeness and its opposite, he becomes a knower of Brahman.'] ; na anusocanti, do not grieve for; gatasun, the departed, whose life has become extinct; agatasun ca, and for those who have not departed, whose life has not left, the living. The ideas is, 'Your are sorrowing for those who are eternal in the real sense, and who are not to be grieved for. Hence your are a fool!.'"

      "English": "2.11 The Lord said You are grieving for those who do not deserve to be grieved for. You also speak words of wisdom about the nature of the body and the self as follows: 'The ancestors fall degraded, deprived of the ritual oblations of food and water' (I. 42). There is no reason for such grief for those who possess the knowledge of the nature of the body and the self. Those who know the exact truth will not grieve for those bodies from which life has departed and for those from whome the principle of life has not departed. They do not grieve for bodies or souls. Hence, in you this contradiction is visible - your grief at the thought 'I shall slay them?' and at the same time your talk about righteousness and unrighteousness, as if it were the result of knowledge of the self as distinct from the body. Therefore you do not know the nature of the body nor of the self which is distinct from the body and is eternal. Nor do you know of duties like war etc., which (as duty) constitute the means for the attainment of the self, nor of the fact that this war (which forms a duty in the present context), if fought without any selfish desire for results, is a means for the attainment of the knowledge of the true nature of the self. The implied meaning is this: This self, verily, is not dependent on the body for Its existence, nor is It subjected to destruction on the death of the body, as there is no birth or death for It. Therefore there is no cause for grief. But the body is insentient by nature, is subject to change, and its birth and death are natural; thus it (body) too is not to be grieved for. First listen about the nature of the self."

      "English": "2.12 Indeed, I, the Lord of all, who is eternal, was never non-existent, but existed always. It is not that these selves like you, who are subject to My Lordship, did not exist; you have always existed. It is not that 'all of us', I and you, shall cease to be 'in the future', i.e., beyond the present time; we shall always exist. Even as no doubt can be entertainted that I, the Supreme Self and Lord of all, am eternal, likewise, you (Arjuna and all others) who are embodied selves, also should be considered eternal. The foregoing implies that the difference between the Lord, the sovereign over all, and the individual selves, as also the differences among the individual selves themselves, are real. This has been declared by the Lord Himself. For, different terms like 'I', 'you', 'these', 'all' and 'we' have been used by the Lord while explaining the truth of eternality in order to remove the misunderstanding of Arjuna who is deluded by ignorance. [Now follows a refutation of the Upadhi theory of Bhaskara and the Ignorance theory of the Advaitins which deny any ultimate difference between the Lord and the Jivas.] If we examine (Bhaskara's) theory of Upadhis (adjuncts), which states that the apparent differences among Jivas are due to adjuncts, it will have to be admitted that mention about differences is out of place when explaining the ultimate truth, because the theory holds that there are no such differences in reality. But that the differences mentioned by the Lord are natural, is taught by the Sruti also: 'Eternal among eternals, sentient among sentients, the one, who fulfils the desires of the many' (Sve. U. VI. 13, Ka. U. V. 13). The meaning of the text is: Among the eternal sentient beings who are countless, He, who is the Supreme Spirit, fulfils the desires of all.' As regards the theory of the Advaitins that the perception of difference is brought about by ignorance only and is not really real, the Supreme Being - whose vision must be true and who, therefore must have an immediate cognition of the differencelss and immutable and eternal consciousness as constituting the nature of the Atman in all authenticity, and who must thery be always free from all ignorance and its effects - cannot possibly perceive the so-called difference arising from ignornace. It is, therefore, unimaginable that He engages himself in activities such as teaching, which can proceed only from such a perception of differences arising from ignorance. The argument that the Supreme Being, though possessed of the understanding of nom-duality, can still have the awareness of such difference persisting even after sublation, just as a piece of cloth may have been burnt up and yet continues to have the appearance of cloth, and that such a continuance of the subltated does not cause bondage - such an argument is invalid in the light of another analogy of a similar kind, namely, the perception of the mirage, which, when understood to be what it is, does not make one endeavour to fetch water therefrom. In the same way even if the impression of difference negated by the non-dualistic illumination persists, it cannot impel one to activities such as teaching; for the object to whom the instruction is to be imparted is discovered to be unreal. The idea is that just as the discovery of the non-existence of water in a mirage stops all effort to get water from it, so also when all duality is sublated by illumination, no activity like teaching disciples etc., can take place. Nor can the Lord be conceived as having been previously ignorant and as attaining knowledge of unity through the scirptures, and as still being subject to the continuation of the stultified experiences. Such a position would stand in contradiction to the Sruti and the Smrti: 'He, who is all-comprehender' (Mun. U., 1. 1. 9); all knower and supreme and natural power of varied types are spoken of in Srutis, such as knowledge, strength and action' (Sve. U. 6. 8); 'I know, Arjuna, all beings of the past, present and future but no one knows Me,' etc. (Gita 7. 26). And again, if the perception of difference and distinction are said to persist even after the unitary Self has been decisively understood, the estion will arise - to whom will the Lord and the succession of teachers of the tradition impart the knowledge in accordance with their understanding? The estion needs an answer. The idea is that knowledge of non-duality and perception of differences cannot co-exist. If it be replied by Advaitins holding the Bimba-Pratibimba (the original and reflections) theory that teachers give instructions to their own reflections in the form of disciples such as Arjuna, it would amount to an absurdity. For, no one who is not out of his senses would undertake to give any instruction to his own reflections in mediums such as a precious stone, the blade of a sword or a mirror, knowing, as he does, that they are non-different from himself. The theory of the persistence of the sublated is thus impossible to maintain, as the knowledge of the unitary self destroys the beginningless ignorance in which differences falling outside the self are supposed to be rooted. 'The persistence of the sublated' does occur in cases such as the vision of the two moons, where the cause of the vision is the result of some real defect in eyesight, nor removable by the right understanding of the singleness of the moon. Even though the perception of the two moons may continue, the sublated cognition is rendered inconseential on the strength of strong contrary evidence. For, it will not lead to any activity appropriate for a real experience. But in the present context (i.e. the Advaitic), the conception of difference, whose object and cause are admittedly unreal, is cancelled by the knowledge of reality. So the 'persistence of the sublated' can in no way happen. Thus, if the Supreme Lord and the present succession of preceptors have attained the understanding of (Non-dual) reality, their perception of difference and work such as teaching proceeding from that perception, are impossible. If, on the other hand, the perception of difference persists because of the continuance of ignorance and its cause, then these teachers are themselves ignorant of the truth, and they will be incapable of teaching the truth. Further, as the preceptor has attained the knowledge of the unitary self and thery the ignorance concerning Brahman and all the effects of such ignorance are thus annihilated, there is no purpose in instructing the disciple. It it is held that the preceptor and his knowledge are just in the imagination of the disciple, the disciple and his knowledge are similarly the product of the imagination of the preceptor, and as such can not put an end to the ignorance in estion. If it is maintained that the disciple's knowledge destroys ignorance etc., because it contradicts the antecedent state of non-enlightenment, the same can be asserted of the preceptor's knowledge. The futility of such teachings is obvious. Enough of these unsound doctrines which have all been refuted."

To get rid of this bondage (of bodies), embodied beings perform duties like war appropriate to their stations in life with the help of the same bodies in an attitude of detachment from the fruits as prescribed by the scripture. Even to such aspirants, contacts with sense-objects give pleasure and pain, arising from cold, heat and such other things. But these experiences are to be endured till the acts enjoined in the scriptures come to an end. The Lord explains the significance immediately afterwards:"

Asatah, of the unreal, of cold, heat, etc. together with their causes; na vidyate, there is no; bhavah, being, existence, reality; because heat, cold, etc. together with their causes are not substantially real when tested by means of proof. For they are changeful, and whatever is changeful is inconstant. As configurations like pot etc. are unreal since they are not perceived to be different from earth when tested by the eyes, so also are all changeful things unreal because they are not perceived to be different from their (material) causes, and also because they are not perceived before (their) origination and after destruction. Objection: If it be that [Here Ast. has the additional words 'karyasya ghatadeh, the effect, viz pot etc. (and)'.-Tr.] such (material) causes as earth etc. as also their causes are unreal since they are not perceived differently from their causes, in that case, may it not be urged that owing to the nonexistence of those (causes) there will arise the contingency of everything becoming unreal [An entity cannot be said to be unreal merely because it is non-different from its cause. Were it to be asserted as being unreal, then the cause also should be unreal, because there is no entity which is not subject to the law of cuase and effect.]? Vedantin: No, for in all cases there is the experience of two awarenesses, viz the awareness of reality, and the awareness of unreality. [In all cases of perception two awarenesses are involved: one is invariable, and the other is variable. Since the variable is imagined on the invariable, therefore it is proved that there is something which is the substratum of all imagination, and which is neither a cause nor an effect.] That in relation to which the awareness does not change is real; that in relation to which it changes is unreal. Thus, since the distinction between the real and the unreal is dependent on awareness, therefore in all cases (of empirical experiences) everyone has two kinds of awarenesses with regard to the same substratum: (As for instance, the experiences) 'The pot is real', 'The cloth is real', 'The elephant is real' (which experiences) are not like (that of) 'A blue lotus'. [In the empirical experience, 'A blue lotus', there are two awarenesses concerned with two entities, viz the substance (lotus) and the ality (blueness). In the case of the experience, 'The pot is real', etc. the awarenesses are not concerned with substratum and alities, but the awareness of pot,of cloth, etc. are superimposed on the awareness of 'reality', like that of 'water' in a mirage.] This is how it happens everywhere. [The coexistence of 'reality' and 'pot' etc. are valid only empirically according to the non-dualists; whereas the coexistence of 'blueness' and 'lotus' is real according to the dualists.] Of these two awareness, the awareness of pot etc. is inconstant; and thus has it been shown above. But the awareness of reality is not (inconstant). Therefore the object of the awareness of pot etc. is unreal because of inconstancy; but not so the object of the awareness of reality, because of its constancy. Objection: If it be argued that, since the awareness of pot also changes when the pot is destroyed, therefore the awareness of the pot's reality is also changeful? Vedantin: No, because in cloth etc. the awareness of reality is seen to persist. That awareness relates to the odjective (and not to the noun 'pot'). For this reason also it is not destroyed. [This last sentence has been cited in the f.n. of A.A.-Tr.] Objection: If it be argued that like the awareness of reality, the awareness of a pot also persists in other pots? Vedantin: No, because that (awareness of pot) is not present in (the awareness of) a cloth etc. Objection: May it not be that even the awareness of reality is not present in relation to a pot that has been destroyed? Vedantin: No, because the noun is absent (there). Since the awareness of reality corresponds to the adjective (i.e. it is used adjectivelly), therefore, when the noun is missing there is no possibility of its (that awareness) being an adjective. So, to what should it relate? But, again, the awareness of reality (does not cease) with the absence of an object৷৷ [Even when a pot is absent and the awareness of reality does not arise with regare to it, the awareness of reality persists in the region where the pot had existed. Some read nanu in place of na tu ('But, again'). In that case, the first portion (No,৷৷.since৷৷.adjective. So,৷৷.relate?) is a statement of the Vedantin, and the Objection starts from nanu punah sadbuddheh, etc. so, the next Objection will run thus: 'May it not be said that, when nouns like pot etc. are absent, the awareness of existence has no noun to alify, and therefore it becomes impossible for it (the awareness of existence) to exist in the same substratum?'-Tr.] Objection: May it not be said that, when nouns like pot etc. are absent, (the awareness of existence has no noun to alify and therefore) it becomes impossible for it to exist in the same substratum? [The relationship of an adjective and a noun is seen between two real entities. Therefore, if the relationship between 'pot' and 'reality' be the same as between a noun and an adjective, then both of them will be real entities. So, the coexistence of reality with a non-pot does not stand to reason.] Vedantin: No, because in such experiences as, 'This water exists', (which arises on seeing a mirage etc.) it is observed that there is a coexistence of two objects though one of them is non-existent. Therefore, asatah, of the unreal, viz body etc. and the dualities (heat, cold, etc.), together with their causes; na vidyate, there is no; bhavah, being. And similarly, satah, of the real, of the Self; na vidyate, there is no; abhavah, nonexistence, because It is constant everywhere. This is what we have said. Tu, but; antah, the nature, the conclusion (regarding the nature of the real and the unreal) that the Real is verily real, and the unreal is verily unreal; ubhayoh api, of both these indeed, of the Self and the non-Self, of the Real and the unreal, as explained above; drstah, has been realized thus; tattva-darsibhih, by the seers of Truth. Tat is a pronoun (Sarvanama, lit. name of all) which can be used with regard to all. And all is Brahman. And Its name is tat. The abstraction of tat is tattva, the true nature of Brahman. Those who are apt to realize this are tattva-darsinah, seers of Truth. Therefore, you too, by adopting the vision of the men of realization and giving up sorrow and delusion, forbear the dualities, heat, cold, etc. some of which are definite in their nature, and others inconstant , mentally being convinced that this (phenomenal world) is changeful, verily unreal and appears falsely like water in a mirage. This is the idea. What, again, is that reality which remains verily as the Real and surely for ever? This is being answered in, 'But know That', etc."

      "English": "2.16 'The unreal,' that is, the body, can never come into being. 'The real,' that is, the self, can never cease to be. The finale about these, the body and the self, which can be experienced, has been realised correctly by the seers of the Truth. As analyis ends in conclusion, the term 'finale' is here used. The meaning is this: Non-existence (i.e., perishableness) is the real nature of the body which is in itself insentient. Existence (i.e., imperishableness) is the real nature of the self, which is sentient. [What follows is the justification of describing the body as 'unreal' and as having 'never come into being.'] Non-existence has, indeed, the nature of perishableness, and existence has the nature of imperishableness, as Bhagavan Parasara has said: 'O Brahmana, apart from conscious entity there does not exist any group of things anywhere and at any time. Thus have I taught you what is real existence - how conscious entity is real, and all else is unreal' (V. P., 2.12.43 - 45). 'The Supreme Reality is considered as imperishable by the wise. There is no doubt that what can be obtained from a perishable substance is also perishable' (Ibid., 2.14.24). 'That entity which even by a change in time cannot come to possess a difference through modification etc., is real. What is that entity, O King? (It is the self who retains Its knowledge)' (Ibid., 2.13.100). It is said here also: 'These bodies ৷৷. are said to have an end' (2.18) and 'Know That (the Atman) to be indestructible' (2.17). It is seen from this that this (i.e., perishableness of the body and imperishableness of the self) is the reason for the designating the Atman as 'existence' (Sattva) and body as 'non-existence' (Asvattva). This verse has no reference to the doctrine of Satkaryavada (i.e., the theory that effects are present in the cause), as such a theory has no relevance here. Arjuna is deluded about the true nature of the body and the self; so what ought to be taught to him in order to remove his delusion, is discrimination between these two - what is alified by perishablenss and what, by imperishableness. This (declaration) is introduced in the following way: 'For the dead, or for the living' (2.11). Again this poin is made clear immediately (by the words), 'Know that to be indestructible ৷৷.' (2.17) and 'These bodies ৷৷. are said to have an end' (2.18). How the imperishableness of the self is to be understood, Sri Krsna now teaches:"

      "English": "2.18 Ime, these; antavantah, destructible; dehah, bodies as the idea of reality which continues with regard to water in a mirage, etc. gets eliminated when examined with the means of knowledge, and that is its end, so are these bodies and they have an end like bodies etc. in dream and magic ; uktah, are said, by discriminating people; to belong nityasya, to the everlasting; anasinah, the indestructible; aprameyasya, the indeterminable; sarirnah, embodied One, the Self. This is the meaning. The two words 'everlasting' and 'indestructible' are not repetitive, because in common usage everlastingness and destructibility are of two kinds. As for instance, a body which is reduced to ashes and has disappeared is said to have been destoryed. (And) even while existing, when it becomes transfigured by being afflicted with diseases etc. it is said to be 'destroyed'. [Here the A.A. adds 'tatha dhana-nase-apyevam, similar is the case even with regard to loss of wealth.'-Tr.] That being so, by the two words 'everlasting' and 'indestructible' it is meant that It is not subject to both kinds of distruction. Otherwise, the everlastingness of the Self would be like that of the earth etc. Therefore, in order that this contingency may not arise, it is said, 'Of the everlasting, indestructible'. Aprameyasya, of the indeterminable, means 'of that which cannot be determined by such means of knowledge as direct perception etc.' Objection: Is it not that the Self is determined by the scriptures, and before that through direct perception etc.? Vedantin: No, because the Self is self-evident. For, (only) when the Self stands predetermined as the knower, there is a search for a means of knolwedge by the knower. Indeed, it is not that without first determining oneself as, 'I am such', one takes up the task of determining an object of knowledge. For what is called the 'self' does not remain unknown to anyone. But the scripture is the final authority [when the Vedic text establishes Brahman as the innermost Self, all the distinctions such as knower, known and the means of knowledge become sublated. Thus it is reasonable that the Vedic text should be the final authority. Besides, its authority is derived from its being faultless in as much as it has not originated from any human being.]: By way of merely negating superimposition of alities that do not belong to the Self, it attains authoritativeness with regard to the Self, but not by virtue of making some unknown thing known. There is an Upanisadic text in support of this: '৷৷.the Brahman that is immediate and direct, the Self that is within all' (Br. 3.4.1). Since the Self is thus eternal and unchanging, tasmat, therefore; yudhyasva, you join the battle, i.e. do not desist from the war. Here there is no injunction to take up war as a duty, because be (Arjuna), though he was determined for war, remains silent as a result of being overpowered by sorrow and delusion. Therefore, all that is being done by the Lord is the removal of the obstruction to his duty. 'Therefore, join the battle' is only an approval, not an injunction. The scripture Gita is intended for eradicating sorrow, delusion, etc. which are the cases of the cycle of births and deaths; it is not intended to enjoin action. As evidences of this idea the Lord cites two Vedic verses: [Ka. 1.2.19-20. There are slight verbal differences.-Tr.]"

For, jugs and such other things which are characterised by complexity are seen to have an end. The bodies of the embodied self, which are made of conglomerated elements, serve the purpose of experiencing the effects of Karmas, as stated in Brh. U. IV. 4.5, 'Auspicious embodiments are got through good actions.' Such bodies perish when Karmas are exhausted. Further the self is imperishable. Why? Because it is not measurable. Neither can It be conceived as the object of knowledge, but only as the subject (knower). It will be taught later on: 'He who knows It is called the knower of the Field by those who know this (13.1). Besides, the self is not seen to be made up of many (elements). Because in the perception 'I am the knower' throughout the body, only something other than the body is understood as possessing an invariable form as the knower. Further, this knower cannot be dismembered and seen in different places as is the case with the body. Therefore the self is eternal, for (1) It is not a complex being of a single form; (2) It is the knowing subject; and (3) It pervades all. On the contrary, the body is perishable, because (1) it is complex; (2) it serves the purpose of experiencing the fruits of Karma by the embodied self; (3) it has a plurality of parts and (4) it can be pervaded. Therefore, as the body is by nature perishable and the self by nature is eternal, both are not objects fit for grief. Hence, bearing with courage the inevitable strike of weapons, sharp or hard, liable to be received by you and others, begin the action called war without being attached to the fruits but for the sake of attaining immortality."

The A.A. has this phrase in both the places.-Tr.] as 'I am the killer', and he who thinks, 'I have been killed', both of them are ignorant of the nature of the Self. For, ayam, this Self; owing to Its changelessness, na hanti, does not kill, does not become the agent of the act of killing; na hanyate, nor is It killed, i.e. It does not become the object (of the act of killing). The second verse is to show how the Self is changeless:"

      "English": "2.20 Na kadacit, neverl; is ayam, this One; jayate, born i.e. the Self has no change in the form of being born to which matter is subject ; va, and ( va is used in the sense of and); na mriyate, It never dies. By this is denied the final change in the form of destruction. The word (na) kadacit), never, is connected with the denial of all kinds of changes thus never, is It born never does It die, and so on. Since ayam, this Self; bhutva, having come to exist, having experienced the process of origination; na, will not; bhuyah, again; abhavita, cease to be thereafter, therefore It does not die. For, in common parlance, that which ceases to exist after coming into being is said to die. From the use of the word va, nor, and na, it is understood that, unlike the body, this Self does not again come into existence after having been non-existent. Therefore It is not born. For, the words, 'It is born', are used with regard to something which comes into existence after having been non-existent. The Self is not like this. Therfore It is not born. Since this is so, therefore It is ajah, birthless; and since It does not die, therefore It is nityah, eternal. Although all changes become negated by the denial of the first and the last kinds of changes, still changes occuring in the middle [For the six kinds of changes see note under verse 2.10.-Tr.] should be denied with their own respective terms by which they are implied. Therefore the text says sasvatah, undecaying,. so that all the changes, viz youth etc., which have not been mentioned may become negated. The change in the form of decay is denied by the word sasvata, that which lasts for ever. In Its own nature It does not decay because It is free from parts. And again, since it is without alities, there is no degeneration owing to the decay of any ality. Change in the form of growth, which is opposed to decay, is also denied by the word puranah, ancient. A thing that grows by the addition of some parts is said to increase and is also said to be new. But this Self was fresh even in the past due to Its partlessness. Thus It is puranah, i.e. It does not grow. So also, na hanyate, It is puranah, i.e. It does not grow. So also, na hanyate, It is not killed, It does not get transformed; even when sarire, the body; hanyamane, is killed, transformed. The verb 'to kill' has to be understood here in the sense of transformation, so that a tautology [This verse has already mentioned 'death' in the first line. If the verb han, to kill, is also taken in the sense of killing, then a tautology is unavoidable.-Tr.] may be avoided. In this mantra the six kinds of transformations, the material changes seen in the world, are denied in the Self. The meaning of the sentence is that the Self is devoid of all kinds of changes. Since this is so, therefore 'both of them do not know' this is how the present mantra is connected to the earlier mantra."

In this connection, as the statement, 'It is never born, It never dies' is in the present tense, it should be understood that the birth and death which are experienced by all in all bodies, do not touch the self. The statement 'Having come into being once, It never ceases to be' means that this self, having emerged at the beginning of a Kalpa (one aeon of manifestation) will not cease to be at the end of the Kalpa (i.e., will emerge again at the beginning of the next Kalpa unless It is liberated). This is the meaning - that birth at the beginning of a Kalpa in bodies such as those of Brahman and others, and death at the end of a Kalpa as stated in the scriptures, do not touch the self. Hence, the selves in all bodies, are unborn, and therefore eternal. It is abiding, not connected, like matter, with invisible modifications taking place. It is primeval; the meaning is that It existed from time immemorial; It is even new i.e., It is capable of being experienced always as fresh. Therefore, when the body is slain the self is not slain."

हुए अर्थका उपसंहार करते हैं पूर्व मन्त्रमें कहे हुए लक्षणोंसे युक्त इस आत्माको जो अविनाशी अन्तिम भावविकाररूप मरणसे रहित नित्य रोगादिजनित दुर्बलता क्षीणता आदि विकारोंसे रहित अज जन्मरहित और अव्यय अपक्षयरूप विकारसे रहित जानता है। \n वह आत्मतत्त्वका ज्ञाताअधिकारी पुरुष कैसे ( किसको ) मारता है और कैसे ( किसको ) मरवाता है अर्थात् वह कैसे तो हननरूप क्रिया कर सकता और कैसे किसी मारनेवालेको नियुक्त कर सकता है अभिप्राय यह कि वह न किसीको किसी प्रकार भी मारता है और न किसीको किसी प्रकार भी मरवाता है। इन दोनों बातोंमे किम् और कथम् शब्द आक्षेपके बोधक हैं क्योंकि प्रश्नके अर्थमें यहाँ इनका प्रयोग सम्भव नहीं। निर्विकारतारूप हेतुका तात्पर्य सभी कर्मोंका प्रतिषेध करनेमें समान है इससे इस प्रकरणका अर्थ भगवान्को यही इष्ट है कि आत्मवेत्ता किसी भी कर्मका करने करवानेवाला नहीं होता। अकेली हननक्रियाके विषयमें आक्षेप करना उदाहरणके रूपमें है। \n पू O कर्म न हो सकनेमें कौनसे खास हेतुको देखकर ज्ञानीके लिये भगवान् कथं स पुरुषः इस कथनसे कर्मविषयक आक्षेप करते हैं \n उ O पहले ही कह आये हैं कि आत्माकी निर्विकारता ही ( ज्ञानीकर्तृक ) सम्पूर्ण कर्मोंके न होनेका खास हेतु है। \n पू O कहा है सही परंतु अविक्रिय आत्मासे उसको जाननेवाला भिन्न है इसलिये ( यह ऊपर बतलाया हुआ ) खास कारण उपयुक्त नहीं है क्योंकि स्थाणुको अविक्रिय जाननेवालेसे कर्म नहीं होते ऐसा नहीं ऐसी शङ्का करें तो \n उ O यह कहना ठीक नहीं क्योंकि आत्मा स्वयं ही जाननेवाला है। देह आदि संघातमें ( जड होनेके कारण ) ज्ञातापन नहीं हो सकता इसलिये अन्तमें देहादि संघातसे भिन्न आत्मा ही अविक्रिय ठहरता है और वही जाननेवाला है। ऐसे उस ज्ञानीसे कर्म होना असम्भव है अतः कथं स पुरुष यह आक्षेप उचित ही है। \n जैसे ( वास्तवमें ) निर्विकार होनेपर भी आत्मा बुद्धिवृत्ति और आत्माका भेदज्ञान न रहनेके कारण अविद्याके सम्बन्धसे बुद्धि आदि इन्द्रियोंद्वारा ग्रहण किये हुए शब्दादि विषयोंका ग्रहण करनेवाला मान लिया जाता है। ऐसे ही आत्मअनात्मविषयक विवेकज्ञानरूप जो बुद्धिवृत्ति है जिसे विद्या कहते हैं वह यद्यपि असत्रूप है तो भी उसके सम्बन्धसे वास्तव में जो अविकारी है ऐसा आत्मा ही विद्वान् कहा जाता है। ज्ञानीके लिये सभी कर्म असम्भव बतलाये हैं इस कारण भगवान्का यह निश्चय समझा जाता है कि शास्त्रद्वारा जिन कर्मोंका विधान किया गया है वे सब अज्ञानियोंके लिये ही विहित हैं। \n पू O विद्या भी अज्ञानीके लिये ही विहित है क्योंकि जिसने विद्याको जान लिया उसके लिये पिसेको पीसनेकी भाँति विद्याका विधान व्यर्थ है। अतः अज्ञानीके लिये कर्म कहे गये हैं ज्ञानीके लिये नहीं इस प्रकार विभाग करना नहीं बन सकता। \n उ O यह कहना ठीक नहीं क्योंकि कर्तव्यके भाव और अभावसे भिन्नता सिद्ध होती है अभिप्राय यह कि अग्निहोत्रादि कर्मोंका विधान करनेवाले विधिवाक्योंके अर्थको जान लेनेके बाद अनेक साधन और उपसंहारके सहित अमुक अग्निहोत्रादि कर्म अनुष्ठान करनेके योग्य है मैं कर्ता हूँ मेरा अमुक कर्तव्य है इस प्रकार जाननेवाले अज्ञानीके लिये जैसे कर्तव्य बना रहता है वैसे न जायते इत्यादि आत्मस्वरूपका विधान करनेवाले वाक्योंके अर्थको जान लेनेके बाद उस ज्ञानीके लिये कुछ कर्तव्य शेष नहीं रहता। क्योंकि ( ज्ञानीको ) मैं न कर्ता हूँ न भोक्ता हूँ इत्यादि जो आत्माके एकत्व और अकर्तृत्व आदिविषयक ज्ञान है इससे अतिरिक्त अन्य किसी प्रकारका भी ज्ञान नहीं होता। इस प्रकार यह ( ज्ञानी और अज्ञानीके कर्तव्यका ) विभाग सिद्ध होता है। जो अपनेको ऐसा समझता है कि मैं कर्ता हूँ उसकी यह बुद्धि अवश्य ही होगी कि मेरा अमुक कर्तव्य है उस बुद्धिकी अपेक्षासे वह कर्मोंका अधिकारी होता है इसीसे उसके लिये कर्म हैं। और उभौ तौ न विजानीतः इस वचनके अनुसार वही अज्ञानी है। क्योंकि पूर्वोक्त विशेषणोंद्वारा वर्णित ज्ञानीके लिये तो कथं स पुरुषः इस प्रकार कर्मोंका निषेध करनेवाले वचन हैं। सुतरां ( यह सिद्ध हुआ कि ) आत्माको निर्विकार जाननेवाले विशिष्ट विद्वान्का और मुमुक्षुका भी सर्वकर्मसंन्यासमें ही अधिकार है। इसीलिये भगवान् नारायण ज्ञानयोगेन सांख्यानां कर्मयोगेन योगिनाम् इस कथनसे सांख्ययोगी ज्ञानियों और कर्मी अज्ञानियोंका विभाग करके अलगअलग दो निष्ठा ग्रहण करवाते हैं। ऐसे ही अपने पुत्रसे भगवान् वेदव्यासजी कहते हैं कि ये दो मार्ग हैं इत्यादि तथा यह भी कहते हैं कि पहले क्रियामार्ग और पीछे संन्यास। इसी विभागको बारंबार भगवान् दिखलायेंगे। जैसे अहंकारसे मोहित हुआ अज्ञानी मैं कर्ता हूँ ऐसे मानता है तत्त्ववेत्ता मैं नहीं करता ऐसे मानता है तथा सब कर्मोंका मनसे त्यागकर रहता है इत्यादि। इस विषयमें कितने ही अपनेको पण्डित समझनेवाले कहते हैं कि जन्मादि छः भावविकारोंसे रहित निर्विकार अकर्ता एक आत्मा मैं ही हूँ ऐसा ज्ञान किसीको होता ही नहीं कि जिसके होनेसे सर्वकर्मोंके संन्यासका उपदेश किया जा सके। यह कहना ठीक नहीं। क्योंकि ( ऐसा मान लेनेसे ) न जायते इत्यादि शास्त्रका उपदेश व्यर्थ होगा। उनसे यह पूछना चाहिये कि जैसे शास्त्रोपदेशकी सामर्थ्यसे कर्म करनेवाले मनुष्यको धर्मके अस्तित्वका ज्ञान और देहान्तरकी प्राप्तिका ज्ञान होता है उसी तरह उसी पुरुषको शास्त्रसे आत्माकी विर्विकारता अकर्तृत्व और एकत्व आदिका विज्ञान क्यों नहीं हो सकता यदि वे कहें कि ( मनबुद्धि आदि ) करणोंसे आत्मा अगोचर है इस कारण ( उसका ज्ञान नहीं हो सकता )। तो यह कहना ठीक नहीं। क्योंकि मनके द्वारा उस आत्माको देखना चाहिये यह श्रुति है अतः शास्त्र और आचार्यके उपदेशद्वारा एवं शम दम आदि साधनोंद्वारा शुद्ध किया हुआ मन आत्मदर्शनमें करण ( साधन ) है। इस प्रकार उस ज्ञानप्राप्तिके विषयमें अनुमान और आगमप्रमाणोंके रहते हुए भी यह कहना कि ज्ञान नहीं होता साहसमात्र है। यह तो मान ही लेना चाहिये कि उत्पन्न हुआ ज्ञान अपनेसे विपरीत अज्ञानको अवश्य नष्ट कर देता है। वह अज्ञान मैं मारनेवाला हूँ मैं मारा गया हूँ ऐसे मारनेवाले दोनों नहीं जानते इन वचनोंद्वारा पहले दिखलाया ही था फिर यहाँ भी यह बात दिखायी गयी है कि आत्मामें हननक्रियाका कर्तृत्व कर्मत्व और हेतुकर्तृत्व अज्ञानजनति है। आत्मा निर्विकार होनेके कारण कर्तृत्व आदि भावोंका अविद्यामूलक होना सभी क्रियाओंमे समान है। क्योंकि विकारवान् ही ( स्वयं ) कर्ता ( बनकर ) अपने कर्मरूप दूसरेको कर्ममें नियुक्त करता है कि तू अमुक कर्म कर। सुतरां ज्ञानीका कर्मोंमें अधिकार नहीं है यह दिखानेके लिये भगवान् वेदाविनाशिनम् कथं स पुरुषः इत्यादि वाक्योंसे सभी क्रियाओंमें समान भावसे विद्वान्के कर्ता और प्रयोजक कर्ता होनेका प्रतिषेध करते हैं। ज्ञानीका अधिकार किसमें है यह तो ज्ञानयोगेन सांख्यानाम् इत्यादि वचनोंद्वारा पहले ही बतलाया जा चुका है वैसे ही फिर भी सर्वकर्माणि मनसा इत्यादि वाक्योंसे सर्व कर्मोंका संन्यास ( भगवान् ) कहेंगे। \n पू O ( उक्त श्लोकमें ) मनसा यह शब्द है इसलिये मानसिक कर्मोंका ही त्याग बतलाया है शरीर और वाणीसम्बन्धी कर्मोंका नहीं। \n उ O यह कहना ठीक नहीं। क्योंकि सर्व कर्मोंको छोड़कर इस प्रकार कर्मोंके साथ सर्व विशेषण है। \n पू O यदि मनसम्बन्धी सर्व कर्मोंका त्याग मान लिया जाय तो \n उ O ठीक नहीं। क्योंकि वाणी और शरीरकी क्रिया मनोव्यापारपूर्वक ही होती है। मनोव्यापारके अभावमें उनकी क्रिया बन नहीं सकती। \n पू O शास्त्रविहित कायिकवाचिक कर्मोंके कारणरूप मानसिक कर्मोंके सिवा अन्य सब कर्मोंका मनसे संन्यास करना चाहिये यह मान लिया जाय तो \n उ O ठीक नहीं। क्योंकि न करता हुआ और न करवाता हुआ यह विशेषण साथमें है ( इसलिये तीनों तरह कर्मोंका संन्यास सिद्ध होता है। ) \n पू O यह भगवान्द्वारा कहा हुआ सर्व कर्मोंका संन्यास तो मुमूर्षु के लिये है जीते हुएके लिये नहीं यह माना जाय तो \n उ O ठीक नहीं। क्योंकि ऐसा मान लेनेसे नौ द्वारवाले शरीररूप पुरमें आत्मा रहता है इस विशेषणकी उपयोगिता नहीं रहती। कारण जो सर्वकर्मसंन्यास करके मर चुका है उसका न करते हुए और न करवाते हुए उस शरीरमें रहना सम्भव नहीं। \n पू O उक्त वाक्यमें शरीरमें कर्मोंको रखकर इस तरह सम्बन्ध है शरीरमें रहता है इस प्रकार सम्बन्ध नहीं है ऐसा मानें तो \n उ O ठीक नहीं है। क्योंकि सभी जगह आत्माको निर्विकार माना गया है। तथा आसन क्रियाको आधारकी अपेक्षा है और संन्यास को उसकी अपेक्षा नहीं है एवं स पूर्वक न्यास शब्दका अर्थ यहाँ त्यागना। है निक्षेप ( रख देना ) नहीं। सुतरां गीताशास्त्रमें आत्मज्ञानीका संन्यासमें ही अधिकार है कर्मोंमें नहीं। यही बात आगे चलकर आत्मज्ञानके प्रकरणमें हम जगहजगह दिखलायेंगे।",
      "English": "2.21 In the mantra, 'He who thinks of this One as the killer,' having declared that (the Self) does not become the agent or the object of the actof killing, and then in the mantra, 'Never is this One born,' etc., having stated the reasons for (Its) changelessness, the Lord sums up the purport of what was declared above: He who knows this One as indestructible, etc. Yah, he who; veda, knows yah is to be thus connected with Veda ; enam, this One, possessing the characteristics stated in the earlier mantra; as avinasinam, indestructible, devoid of the final change of state; nityam, eternal, devoid of transformation; ajam, birthless; and avyayam, undecaying; katham, how, in what way; (and kam, whom;) does sah, that man of realization; purusah, the person who is himself an authority [i.e. above all injunctions and prohibitions. See 18.16.17.-Tr.]; hanti, kill, undertake the act of killing; or how ghatayati, does he cause (others) to be killed, (how does he) instigate a killer! The intention is to deny both (the acts) by saying, 'In no way does he kill any one, nor does he cause anyone to be killed', because an interrogative sense is absurd (here). Since the implication of the reason [The reason for the denial of killing etc. is the changelessness of the Self, and this reason holds good with regard to all actions of the man of realization.-Tr.], viz the immutability of the Self, [The A.A. omits 'viz the immutability of the Self'.-Tr.] is common (with regard to all actions), therefore the negation of all kinds of actions in the case of a man of realization is what the Lord conveys as the only purport of this context. But the denial of (the act of) killing has been cited by way of an example. Objection: By noticing what special reason for the impossibility of actions in the case of the man of realization does the Lord deny all actions (in his case) by saying, 'How can that person,' etc.? Vedantin: Has not the immutability of the Self been already stated as the reason [Some readings omit this word.-Tr.] , the specific ground for the impossibility of all actions? Objection: It is true that it has been stated; but that is not a specific ground, for the man of realization is different from the immutable Self. Indeed, may it not be argued that action does not become impossible for one who has known as unchanging stump of a tree?! Vedantin: No, because of man of Knowledge is one with the Self. Enlightenment does not belong to the aggregate of body and senses. Therefore, as the last laternative, the knower is the Immutable and is the Self which is not a part of the aggregate. Thus, action being impossible for that man of Knowledge, the denial in, 'How can that person৷৷.,' etc. is reasonable. As on account of the lack of knowledge of the distinction between the Self and the modifications of the intellect, the Self, though verily immutable, is imagined through ignorance to be the perceiver of objects like sound etc. presented by the intellect etc., in this very way, the Self, which in reality is immutable, is said to be the 'knower' because of Its association with the knowledge of the distinction between the Self and non-Self, which (knowledge) is a modification of the intellect [By buddhi-vrtti, modification of the intellect, is meant the transformation of the internal organ into the form of an extension upto an object, along with its past impressions, the senses concerned, etc., like the extension of the light of a lamp illuminating an object. Consciousness reflected on this transformation and remaining indistinguishable from that transformation revealing the object, is called objective knowledge. Thery, due to ignorance, the Self is imagined to be the perceiver because of Its connection with the vrtti, modification. (-A.G.) The process is elsewhere described as follows: The vrtti goes out through the sense-organ concerned, like the flash of a torchlight, and along with it goes the reflection of Consciousness. Both of them envelop the object, a pot for instance. The vrtti destroys the ignorance about the pot; and the reflection of Consciousness, becoming unified with only that portion of it which has been delimited by the pot, reveals the pot. In the case of knowledge of Brahman, it is admitted that the vrtti in the form, 'I am Brahman', does reach Brahman and destroys ignorance about Brahman, but it is not admitted that Brahman is revealed like a 'pot', for Brahman is self-effulgent.-Tr.] and is unreal by nature. From the statement that action is impossible for man of realization it is understood that the conclusion of the Lord is that, actions enjoined by the scriptures are prescribed for the unenlightened. Objection: Is not elightenment too enjoined for the ignorant? For, the injunction about enlightenment to one who has already achieved realization is useless, like grinding something that has already been ground! This being so, the distinction that rites and duties are enjoined for the unenlightened, and not for the enlightened one, does not stand to reason. Vedantin: No. There can reasonable be a distinction between the existence or nonexistence of a thing to be performed. As after the knowledge of the meaning of the injunction for rites like Agnihotra etc. their performance becomes bligatory on the unenlightened one who thinks, 'Agnihotra etc. has to be performed by collecting various accessories; I am the agent, and this is my duty', unlike this, nothing remains later on to be performed as a duty after knowing the meaning of the injunction about the nature of the Self from such texts as, 'Never is this One born,' etc. But apart from the rise of knowledge regarding the unity of the Self, his non-agency, etc., in the form, 'I am not the agent, I am not the enjoyer', etc., no other idea arises. Thus, this distinction can be maintained. Again, for anyone who knows himself as, 'I am the agent', there will necessarily arise the idea, 'This is my duty.' In relation to that he becomes eligible. In this way duties are (enjoined) [Ast. adds 'sambhavanti, become possible'.-Tr.] for him. And according to the text, 'both of them do not know' (19), he is an unenlightened man. And the text, 'How can that person,' etc. concerns the enlightened person distinguished above, becuase of the negation of action (in this text). Therefore, the enlightened person distinguished above, who has realized the immutable Self, and the seeker of Liberation are alified only for renunciation of all rites and duties. Therefore, indeed, the Lord Narayana, making a distinction between the enlightened man of Knowledge and the unenlightened man of rites and duties, makes them take up the two kinds of adherences in the text, 'through the Yoga of Knowledge for the men of realization; through the Yoga of Action for the yogis' (3.3). Similarly also, Vyasa said to his son, 'Now, there are these two paths,' etc. ['Now, there are these two paths on which the Vedas are based. They are thought of as the dharma characterized by engagement in duties, and that by renunciation of them' (Mbh. Sa. 241.6).-Tr.] So also (there is a Vedic text meaning): 'The path of rites and duties, indeed, is the earlier, and renunciation comes after that.' [Ast. says that this is not a otation, but only gives the purport of Tai, Ar. 10.62.12.-Tr.] The Lord will show again and again this very division: 'The unenlightened man who is deluded by egoism thinks thus: \"I am the doer\"; but the one who is a knower of the facts (about the varieties of the gunas) thinks, \"I do not act\"' (cf. 3.27,28). So also there is the text, '(The embodied man of selfcontrol,) having given up all actions mentally, continues (happily in the town of nine gates)' (5.13) etc. With regard to this some wiseacres say: In no person does arise the idea, 'I am the changeless, actionless Self, which is One and devoid of the six kinds of changes beginning with birth to which all things are subject', on the occurrence of which (idea alone) can renunciation of all actions be enjoined. That is not correct, because it will lead to the needlessness of such scriptural instructions as, 'Never is this One born,' etc. (20). They should be asked: As on the authority of scripural instructions there arises the knowledge of the existence of virtue and vice and the knowledge regarding an agent who gets associated with successive bodies, similarly, why should not there arise from the scriptures the knowledge of unchangeability, non-agentship, oneness, etc. of that very Self? Objection: If it be said that this is due to Its being beyond the scope of any means (of knowledge)? Vedantin: No, because the Sruti says, 'It is to be realized through the mind alone, (following the instruction of the teacher)' (Br. 4.4.19). The mind that is purified by the instructions of the scriptures and the teacher, control of the body and organs, etc. becomes the instrument for realizing the Self. Again, since there exist inference and scriptures for Its realization, it is mere bravado to say that Knowledge does not arise. And it has to be granted that when knowledge arises, it surely eliminates ignorance, its opposite. And that ignorance has been shown in, 'I am the killer', 'I am killed', and 'both of them do not know' (see 2.19). And here also it is shown that the idea of the Self being an agent, the object of an action, or an indirect agent, is the result of ignorance. Also, the Self being changeless, the fact that such agentship etc. are cuased by ignorance is a common factor in all actions without exception, because only that agent who is subject to change instigates someone else who is different from himself and can be acted on, saying, 'Do this.' Thus, with a view to pointing out the absence of fitness for rites and duties in the case of an enlightened person, the Lord [Ast, adds vasudeva after 'Lord'.-Tr.] says, 'He who knows this One as indestructible,' 'how can that person,' etc. thery denying this direct and indirect agentship of an enlightened person in respect of all actions without exception. As regards the estion, 'For what, again, is the man of enlightenment alified?', the answer has already been give earlier in, 'through the Yoga of Knowledge for the men of realization' (3.3). Similarly, the Lord will also speak of renunication of all actions in, 'having given up all actions mentally,' etc.(5.13). Objection: May it not be argued that from the expression, 'mentally', (it follows that) oral and bodily actions are not to be renounced? Vedantin: No, because of the categoric expression, 'all actions'. Objection: May it not be argued that 'all actions' relates only to those of the mind? Vedantin: No, because all oral and bodily actions are preceded by those of the mind, for those actions are impossible in the absence of mental activity. Objection: May it not be said that one has to mentally renounce all other activities except the mental functions which are the causes of scriptural rites and duties performed through speech and body? Vedantin: No, because it has been specifically expressed: 'without doing or causing (others) to do anything at all' (5.13). Objection: May it not be that this renunciation of all actions, as stated by the Lord, is with regard to a dying man, not one living? Vedantin: No, because (in that case) the specific statement, 'The embodied man৷৷.continues happily in the town of nine gates' (ibid.) will become illogical since it is not possible for a dead person, who neither acts nor makes others act, [The words 'akurvatah akarayatah, (of him) who neither acts nor makes others act', have been taken as a part of the Commentator's arguement. But A.G. points out that they can also form a part of the next Objection. In that, case, the translation of the Objection will be this: Can it not be that the construction of the sentence (under discussion) is Neither doing nor making others do, he rest by depositing (sannyasya, by renouncing) in the body', but not 'he rests in the body by renouncing৷৷.'?] to rest in that body after renouncing all actions. Objection: Can it not be that the construction of the sentence (under discussion) is, '(he rests) by depositing (sannyasya, by renouncing) in the body', (but) not 'he rests in the body by renouncing৷৷.'? Vedantin: No, because everywhere it is categorically asserted that the Self is changeless. Besides, the action of 'resting' reires a location, whereas renunciation is independent of this. The word nyasa preceded by sam here means 'renunciation', not 'depositing'. Therefore, according to this Scripture, viz the Gita, the man of realization is eligible for renunciation, alone, not for rites and duties. This we shall show in the relevant texts later on in the cotext of the knowledge of the Self. And now we shall speak of the matter on hand: As to that, the indestructibility [Indestructibility suggests unchangeability as well.] of the Self, has been postulated. What is it like? That is being said in, 'As after rejecting wornout clothes,' etc."

      "English": "2.21 He who knows the self to be eternal, as It is indestructible, unborn and changeless - how can that person be said to cause the death of the self, be it of the self existing in the bodies of gods or animals or immovables? Whom does he kill? The meaning is - how can he destroy any one or cause anyone to slay? How does he become an instrument for slaying? The meaning is this: the feeling of sorrow: 'I cause the slaying of these selves, I slay these,' has its basis solely in ignorance about the true nature of the self. Let it be granted that what is done is only separation of the bodies from the eternal selves. Even then, when the bodies, which are instruments for the experience of agreeable pleasures, perish, there still exists reason for sorrow in their separation from the bodies.

When arranged in a particular way, they are called clothes etc. It is seen that even those who uphold the doctrine that the effect is a new entity (Asatkarya-vadins) will admit this much that no new entity over and above the particular arrangement of threads is seen. It is not tenable to hold that this is the coming into being of a new entity, since, by the process of manufacture there is only attainment of a new name and special functions. No new entity emerges. Origination, annihilation etc., are thus particular stages of an existent entity. With regard to an entity which has entered into a stage known as origination, its entry into the opposite condition is called annihilation. Of an evolving entity, a seqence of evolutionary stages is inevitable. For instance, clay becomes a lump, jug, a potsherd, and (finally) powder. Here, what is called annihilation is the attainment of a succeeding stage by an entity which existed previously in a preceding stage. And this annihilation itself is called birth in that stage. Thus, the seence called birth and annihilation being inevitable for an evolving entity, it is not worthy of you to grieve. Now Sri Krsna says that not even the slightest grief arising from seeing an entity passing from a previous existing stage to an opposite stage, is justifiable in regard to human beings etc."

Accordingly has it been said: 'They emerged from invisibility, and have gone back to invisibility. They are not yours, nor are you theirs. What is this fruitless lamentation!' (Mbh. St. 2.13). Ka, what; paridevana, lamentation, or what prattle, can there be; tatra, with regard to them, i.e. with regard to beings which are objects of delusion, which are invisible, (become) visible, (and then) get destroyed!"

As they thus exist in their own natural stages, there is no cause for grief. After thus saying that there is no cause for grief even according to the view which identifies the body with the self, Sri Krsna proceeds to say that it is hard to find one who can be said to have truly perceived the Atman or spoken about It or heard about It or gained a true conception of It by hearing. For the Atman, which is actually different from the body, is of a wonderful nature."

In Agnisomiya etc., no injury is caused to the animal to be immolated; for, according to the Vedic Text, the victim, a he-goat, after abandoning an inferior body, will attain heaven etc., with a beautiful body. The Text pertaining to immolation declares: 'O animal, by this (immolation) you will never die, you are not destroyed. You will pass through happy paths to the realm of the gods, where the virtuous only reach and not the sinful. May the god Savitr give you a proper place.' (Yaj. 4.6.9.46).

This is the purport. Sri Krsna then explains to the aspirant for liberation how to conduct oneself in war."

The real context here (in 2.12 etc.), however, is of the realization of the supreme Reality. Now, in order to show the distinction between the (two) topics dealt with in this scripture, the Lord concludes that topic which has been presented above (in 2.20 etc.), by saying, 'This (wisdom) has been imparted,' etc. For, if the distinction between the topics of the scripute be shown here, then the instruction relating to the two kinds of adherences as stated later on in, 'through the Yoga of Knowledge for the men of realization; through the Yoga of Action for the yogis' (3.3) will proceed again smoothly, and the hearer also will easily comprehend it by keeping in view the distinction between the topics.

      "English": "2.41 Here, i.e., in every ritual sanctioned by the scriptures, the Buddhi or disposition of mind marked by resolution, is single. The Buddhi marked by resolution is the Buddhi concerned with acts which must be performed by one desirous of release (and not any kind of work). The term 'Vyavasaya' menas unshakable conviction: this Buddhi (disposition of mind) comes out of prior determination about the true nature of the self. But the Buddhi concerning the performance of rituals of fulfill certain desires, is marked by irresolution; because here only this much knowledge of the self is sufficient - 'the self (as an entity) exists differently from the body.' Such a general understanding is sufficient to alify for performing acts giving fulfilment of certain desires. It does not reire any definite knowledge about the true nature of the self. For, even if there is no such knowledge, desires for heaven etc., can arise, the means for their attainment can be adopted, and the experience of those fruits can take place. For this reason there is no contradiction in the teaching of the scriptures. [The contradiction negated here is how can the same scriptural acts produce different results - fulfilment of desires and liberation. The difference in the disposition of the mind accouts of it.] The Buddhi (mental disposition) marked by resolution has a single aim, because it relates to the attainment of a single fruit. For, as far as one desiring release is concerned, all acts are enjoined only for the accomplishment of that single fruit. Therefore, since the purpose of the scriptures here is one only (i.e., liberation), the Buddhi regarding all rituals taught in the scriptures too is only one, as far as liberation-seekers are concerned. For example, the set of six sacrifices, beginning with Agneya with all their subsidiary processes (though enjoined in different passages) forms the subject of a single injunction, as they are all for the attainment of a single fruit. Conseently the Buddhi concerning these is one only. The meaning of the verse under discussion must be construed in the same manner. But the Buddhi of the irresolute ones who are engaged in rituals for winning such fruits as heaven, sons, cattle, food etc., are endless, frutis being endless. In rituals like Darsapurnamasa (new moon and full moon sacrifice), even though attainment of a single fruit (heaven) is enjoined, there accrues to these the character of having many branches on account of the mention of many secondary fruits as evidenced by such passages as, 'He desires a long life.' Therefore the Buddhi of irresolute ones has many branches and are endless. The purport is: In performing obligatory and occasional rituals, all fruits, primary and secondary, promised in the scriptures, should be abandoned, with the idea that release or salvation is the only purpose of all scripture-ordained rituals. These rituals should be performed without any thought of selfish gains. In addition, acts motivated by desires (Kamya-karmas) also should be performed according to one's own capacity, after abandoning all desire for fruits and with the conviction that they also, when performed in that way, form the means for attainment of release. They should be looked upon as eal to obligatory and occasional rites suited to one's own station and stage in life. Sri Krsna condemns those who perform acts for the attainment of objects of desire:"

It may be estioned why the Vedas, which have more of love for Jivas than thousands of parents, and which are endeavouring to save the Jivas, should prescribe in this way rites whose fruits are infinitesimal and which produce only new births. It can also be asked if it is proper to abandon what is given in the Vedas. Sri Krsna replies to these estions."

      "English": "2.45 The word Traigunya means the three Gunas - Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. Here the term Traigunya denotes persons in whom Sattva, Rajas and Tamas are in abundance. The Vedas in prescribing desire-oriented rituals (Kamya-karmas) have such persons in view. Because of their great love, the Vedas teach what is good to those in whom Tamas, Rajas and Sattva preponderate. If the Vedas had not explained to these persons the means for the attainment of heaven etc., according to the Gunas, then those persons who are not interested in liberation owing to absence of Sattva and preponderance of Rajas and Tamas in them, would get completely lost amidst what should not be resorted to, without knowing the means for attaining the results they desire. Hence the Vedas are concerned with the Gunas. Be you free from the three Gunas. Try to acire Sattva in abundance; increase that alone. The purport is: do not nurse the preponderance of the three Gunas in their state of inter-mixture; do not cultivate such preponderance. Be free from the pairs of opposites; be free from all the characteristics of worldly life. Abide in pure Sattva; be established in Sattva, in its state of purity without the admixture of the other two Gunas. If it is estioned how that is possible, the reply is as follows. Never care to acire things nor protect what has been acired. While abandoning the acisition of what is not reired for self-realisation, abandon also the conservation of such things already acired. You can thus be established in self-control and thery become an aspirant after the essentail nature of the self. 'Yoga' is acisition of what has not been acired; 'Ksema' is preservation of things already acired. Abandoning these is a must for an aspirant after the essential nature of the self. If you conduct yourself in this way, the preponderance of Rajas and Tamas will be annihilated, and pure Sattva will develop. Besides, all that is taught in the Vedas is not fit to be utilised by all."

      "English": "2.49 All other kinds of action are far inferior to those done with evenness of mind, which consists in the renunciation of the main result and with eanimity towards success or failure in respect of the secondary results. Between the two kinds of actions, the one with eanimity and the other with attachment, the former associated with eanimity removes all the sufferings of Samsara and leads to release which is the highest object of human existence. The latter type of actions, which is pursued with an eye on results, leads one to Samsara whose character is endless suffering. Thus when an act is being done, take refuge in Buddhi (evenness of mind). Refuge means abode. Live in that Buddhi, is the meaning. 'Miserable are they who act with a motive for results': it means, 'Those who act with attachment to the results, etc., are miserable, as they will continue in Samsara.'"

In answer it is said that gross attachments are eliminated through discrimination which restrains the senses from being overpowered by objects. And the full Knowledge arising thereof eliminates the subtle inclinations as well. Hence there is no vicious circle involved.] Since the organs have to be first brought under his own control by one who desires to establish firmly the wisdom which is characterized by full realization, therefore the Lord speaks of the evil that arises from not keeping them under control:"

The unfitness of the mind to discriminate between what should or should not be done is called loss of understanding. Buddhi-nasat, from the loss of understanding; pranasyati, he perishes. Indeed, a man continues tobe himself so long as his mind remains fit to distinguish between what he ought to and ought not do. When it becomes unfit, a man is verily ruined. Therefore, when his internal organ, his understanding, is destroyed, a man is ruined, i.e. he becomes unfit for the human Goal. Thinking of objects has been said to be the root of all evils. After that, this which is the cause of Liberation is being now stated: [If even the memory of objects be a source of evil, then their enjoyment is more so. Hence, a sannyasin seeking Liberation cannot avoid this evil, since he has to move about for food which is necessary for the maintenance of his body. The present verse is an answer to this apprehension.]"

      "English": "2.69 ya, that which; sarva-bhutanam, for all creatures; is nisa, night which being darkness (tamah) by nature, obliterates distinctions among all things; what is that? that is the Reality which is the supreme Goal, accessible to the man of steady wisdom. As that which verily appears as day to the nocturnal creatures is night for others, similarly the Reality wich is the supreme Goal appears to be night, as it were, to all unenlightened beings who are comparable to the nocturnal creatures, because It is beyond the range of vision of those who are devoid of that wisdom. Samyami, the self-restrained man, whose organs are under control, i.e. the yogi [The man of realization.] who has arisen from the sleep of ignorance; jagarti, keeps awake; tasyam, in that (night) characterized as the Reality, the supreme Goal. That night of ignorance, characterized by the distinctions of subjects and objects, yasyam in which; bhutani, the creatures, who are really asleep; are said to be jagrati, keeping awake, in which night they are like dreamers in sleep; sa nisa, it is night; pasyatah, to the seeing; muneh, sage, who perceives the Reality that is the supreme Goal, because that (night) is ignorance by nature. Therefore, rites and duties are enjoined only during the state of ignorance, not in the state of enlightenment. For, when Knowledge dawns, ignorance becomes eradicated like the darkness of night after sun-rise. [It may be argued that even after illumination the phenomenal world, though it is known to be false, will continue to be perceived because of the persistence of past impressions; therefore there is scope for the validity of the scriptural injunctions even in the case of an illumined soul. The answer is that there will be no scope for the injunctions, because the man of realization will then have no ardent leaning towards this differentiated phenomenal world which makes an injunction relevant.] Before the rise of Knowledge, ignorance, accepted as a valid means of knowledge and presenting itself in the different forms of actions, means and results, becomes the cause of all rites and duties. It cannot reasonably become the source of rites and duties (after Realization) when it is understood as an invalid means of knowledge. For an agent becomes engaged in actions when he has the idea, 'Actions have been enjoined as a duty for me by the Vedas, which are a valid means of knowledge'; but not when he understands that 'all this is mere ignorance, like the night'. Again, the man to whom has come the Knowledge that all these differences in their totality are mere ignorance like the night, to that man who has realized the Self, there is eligibility only for renouncing all actions, not for engaging in actions. In accordance with this the Lord will show in the verse, 'Those who have their intellect absorbed in That, whose Self is That' (5.17) etc., that he has competence only for steadfastness in Knowledge. Objection: May it not be argued that, there will be no reason for being engaged even in that (steadfastness in Knowledge) if there be no valid means of knowledge [Vedic injunctions.] to impel one to that. [Because, without an injunction nobody would engage in a duty, much less in steadfastness to Knowledge.] Answer: No, since 'knowledge of the Self' relates to one's own Self. Indeed, by the very fact that It is the Self, and since the validity of all the means of knowledge culminates in It, [The validity of all the means of knowledge holds good only so long as the knowledge of the Self has not arisen.] therefore the Self does not depend on an injunction to impel It towards Itself. [Does the injunction relate to the knowledge of the Self. or to the Self Itself? The first alternative is untenable because a valid means of knowledge reveals its objects even without an injunction. The second alternative also is untenable because the Self is self-revealing, whereas an injunction is possible in the case of something yet to be achieved. And one's own Self is not an object of that kind.] Surely, after the realization of the true nature of the Self, there is no scope again for any means to, or end of, knowledge. The last valid means of (Self-) knowledge eradicates the possibility of the Self's becoming a perceiver. And even as it eradicates, it loses its own authoritativeness, in the same way as the means of knowledge which is valid in dream becomes unauthoritative during the waking state. In the world, too, after the preception of an abject, the valid means of that perception is not seen to be a cause impelling the knower (to any action with regard to that object). Hence, it is established that, for an knower of the Self, there remains no eligibility for rites and duties. The attainment of Liberation is only for the sannyasin [Liberation is attained only by one who, after aciring an intellectual knowledge of the Self in a general way, is endowed with discrimination and detachment, has arisen above all desires, has become a monk in the primary sense, and has directly realized the Self by going through the process of sravana (understanding of Upanisadic texts about the Self), etc.], the man of enlightenment, who has renounced all desires and is a man of steady wisdom; but not for him who has not renounced and is desirious of the objects (of the senses). Such being the case, with a view to establishing this with the help of an illustration, the Lord says:"

Arjuna was under the delusion that the body is itself the self, and dominated by that delusion, had retreated from battle. He was therefore taught the knowledge called 'Sankhya' or the understanding of the self, and Yoga or what is called the path of practical work without attachment.

What may be the reason for this?', and also in, 'Tatkim, why then, O Kesava; niyojayasi, do You urge; mam, me; to ghore, horrible, cruel; karmani, action; involving injury?'-that (censure) also does not become reasonable.

Now then, which is that steadfastness of two kinds? In answer the Lord says: The steadfastness jnanayogena, through the Yoga of Knowledge-Knowledge itself being the Yoga [Here jnana, Knowledge, refers to the knowledge of the supreme Reality, and Yoga is used in the derivative sense of 'that (Knowledge) through which one gets united with Brahman'.]-; had been stated sankhyanam, for the men of realization-those possessed of the Knowledge arising from the discrimination with regard to the Self and the not-Self, those who have espoused monasticism from the stage of Celibacy; itself, those to whom the entity presented by the Vedantic knowledge has become fully ascertained (see Mu. 3.2.6)-,the monks who are known as the parama-hamsas, those who are established in Brahman alone. And the steadfastness karma-yogena, through the Yoga of Action-action itself being the Yoga [Yoga here means 'that through which one gets united with, comes to have, prosperity', i.e. such actions as go by the name of righteousness and are prescribed by the scriptures.] had been stated yoginam, for the yogis, the men of action (rites and duties). This is the idea. Again, had it been intended or stated or if it will be stated in the Gita by the Lord-and if it has also been so stated in the Vedas-that Knowledge and action are to be practised in combination by one and the same person for attaining the same human Goal, why then should He here tell His dear supplicant Arjuna, that steadfastness in either Knowledge or action is to be practised only by different persons who are respectively alified? If, on the other hand, it be supposed that the Lord's idea is, 'After hearing about both Knowledge and action, Arjuna will himself practise them (in combination); but, to others, I shall speak of them as being meant to be pursued by different persons', then the Lord would be imagined to be unreliable, being possessed of likes and dislikes! And that is untenable. So, from no point of view whatsoever can there be a combination of Knowledge and action. And what has been said by Arjuna regarding superiority of Wisdom over action, that stands confirmed for not having been refuted; and (it also stands confirmed) that steadfastness in Knowledge is suitable for being practised by monks alone. And from the statement that they (Knowledge and action) are to be followed by different persons, it is understood that this has the Lord's approval. Noticing that Arjuna had become dejected under the impression, 'You are urging me to that very action which is a source of bondage', and was thinking thus, 'I shall not undertake action', the Lord said, 'Na karmanam anarambhat, not by abstaining from action,' etc. Or:-When steadfastness in Knowledge and steadfastness in action become incapable of being pursued simultaneously by one and the same person owing to mutual contradiction, then, since it may be concluded that they become the cause of attaining the human Goal independently of each other, therefore, in order to show-that the steadfastness in action is a means to the human Goal, not independently, but by virtue of being instrumental in securing steadfastness in Knowledge; and that, on the other hand, steadfastness in Knowledge, having come into being through the means of steadfastness in action, leads to the human Goal independently without anticipating anything else-,the Lord said:"

But he who performs the worship of the Supreme Person without desire for fruits and thery gets completely rid of inner impurities and keeps his senses unagitated - he becomes competent for the path of knowledge. That all activities are for performing the worship of the Supreme Person will be taught in the Gita verse, 'He from `whom the activities of all beings arise and by whom all this is pervaded - by worshipping Him with his duty man reaches perfection' (18.46). Earlier also performance of activities without any attachment to the fruits is enjoined by the verse beginning with. 'You have the right to work alone ৷৷.' (2.47). Next for those whose intellect has been redeemed by this kind of discipline, is enjoined Jnana Yoga by the words, 'When a man renounces all the desires ৷৷.' (2.55). Conseently, firm devotion to Jnana Yoga is taught only to the Sankhyas, i.e., those persons who are competent to follow the discipline of the knowledge of the self, and Karma Yoga to Yogins, i.e., to those competent for the path of work. Sankhya means Buddhi and those who are endowed with the Buddhi (intellectual or mental disposition) having only the self for its object, are Sankhyans. Therefore those who are not fit for this are alified for Karma Yoga. Those who are possessed of Buddhi which is agitated by objects of the senses, are the persons alified for Karma Yoga, whereas those whose Buddhi is not thus agitated, are alified for Jnana Yoga. Therefore nothing contradictory and confusing is taught. It is said in the next stanza that Jnana Yoga is difficult to practise all at once, even when the desire for release arises in any worldy person:"

      "English": "3.4 Purusah, a person; na does not; asnute, attain; naiskarmyam, freedom from action, the state of being free from action, steadfastness in the Yoga of Knowledge, i.e. the state of abiding in one's own Self which is free from action; anarambhat, by abstaining; karmanam, from actions-by the non-performance of actions such as sacrifices etc. which are or were performed in the present or past lives, which are the causes of the purification of the mind by way of attenuating the sins incurred, and which, by being the cause of that (purification), become the source of steadfastness in Knowledge through the generation of Knowledge, as stated in the Smrti (text), 'Knowledge arises in a person from the attenuation of sinful acts' [the whole verse is: Jnanam utpadyate pumsamksayatpapasya karmanah; Yathadarsatalaprakhye pasyatyatmanamatmani. 'Knowledge arises৷৷.acts. One sees the Self in oneself as does one (see oneself) in a cleaned surface of a mirror'.-Tr.] (Mbh. Sa. 204.8). This is the import. From the statement that one does not attain freedom from action by abstaining from actions, it may be concluded that one attains freedom from action by following the opposite course of performing actions. What, again, is the reason that one does not attain freedom from action by abstaining from actions? The answer is: Because performing actions is itself a means to freedom from action. Indeed, there can be no attainment of an end without (its) means. And Karma-yoga is the means to the Yoga of Knowledge characterized by freedom from action, because it has been so established in the Upanisads and here as well. As for the Upanisads, it has been shown in the texts, 'The Brahmanas seek to know It through the study of the Vedas, sacrifices, (charity, and austerity consisting in a dispassionate enjoyment of sense-objects)' (Br. 4.4.22), etc. whch deal with the means of realizing the goal of Knowledge under discussion, viz the Realm of the Self, that the Yoga of Karma is a means to the Yoga of Knowledge . And even here (in the Gita), the Lord will established that, 'But, O mighty-armed one, renunciation is hard to attain without (Karma-)yoga' (5.6); 'By giving up attachment, the yogis undertake work৷৷.for the purification of themselves' (5.11); 'Sacrifice, charity and austerity are verily the purifiers of the wise' (18.5), etc. Objection: Is it not that in such texts as-'Extending to all creatures immunity from fear' (Na. Par. 5.43), (one should take recourse to freedom from action)-, it is shown that attainment of freedom from action follows even from the renunciation of obligatory duties? And in the world, too, it is a better known fact that freedom from action follows abstention from actions. Hence also arises the estion, 'Why should one who desires freedom from action undertake action?' Reply: Therefore the Lord said: Na ca, nor; samadhi-gacchati, does he attain; siddhim, fulfilment steadfastness in the Yoga of Knowledge, characterized by freedom from action; sannyasanat eva, merely through renunciation-even from the mere renunciation of actions which is devoid of Knowledge. What, again, is the reason that by the mere giving up of actions which is not accompanied with Knowledge, a person does not attain fulfulment in the form of freedom from actions? To this ery seeking to know the cause, the Lord says:"

For Karma-yoga is meant only for the unenlightened, nor for the men of Knowledge. Karma-yoga, on the other hand, is not pertinent for the men of Knowledge who, because of their not moving away from their own Self, are not shaken by the gunas.

    "Ramanujacharya": {
      "Hindi": "Not Availble - Coming Soon",
      "English": "3.8 'Obligatory' (Niyatam) means 'concomitant' (Vyaptam); for action is concomitant with that which is conjoined with Prakrti or the body. The contact with Prakrti has arisen from beginingless subtle impressions (Vasanas). You must perform work, because the performance of action is easy and may not cause accidents by reason of its being obligatory. Action is superior to non-action, i.e., even to the devotee of Jnana. Because of the instruction at the beginning (of this context), 'No man experiences freedom from activity' (3.4), devotion to Jnana alone is indicated by the word, 'Non-action' (Akarma). Even in the case of one alified for devotion to Jnana, devotion to Karma indeed is better because Jnana-nistha is difficult to perform and liable to accidents, as it has not been practised previoulsy and as it does not come to one naturally. Subseently it will be described how, one with the knowledge of the true nature of the self can carry on actions along with that knowledge. Conseently, we should take the meaning here to be that, because knowledge of the self too is included in Karma Yoga, this kind of Yoga is superior. This statement on the superiority of activity (Karma Yoga) over Jnana Yoga is valid even when there is competency for one to adopt Jnana Yoga. For, if you abandon all activities to alify yourself for Jnana Yoga, then, for you, who is thus inactive while following Jnana Yoga, even the nourishment of the body, which is necessary even for Jnana-nistha, will not be achieved. The body has to be necessarily sustained until the means are executed to the full. Performing 'great sacrifices' with the help of honestly earned wealth, the body should be sustained by consuming the remainders left after such sacrifices. This is made clear from scriptural texts like, 'When the food is pure, the Sattva (mind or inner organ) becomes pure; when the Sattva is pure, then the remembrance (meditation) will be steady' (Cha. U., 7.26.2). Sri Krsna himself will declare: 'The sinful ones who cook food for their own sake eat sin (3.13). Conseently,even the sustenance of the body will not be possible in the case of one who practises Jnana-nistha, and does not act. In other ways also Karma Yoga is superior to Jnana Yoga even in respect of one who is alified for Jnana-nistha; for, obligatory and occasional rites like the 'great sacrifices' must be carried out by one who follows Jnana Yoga too, as he has to sustain the body until he attains perfection. Besides, the understanding of the true nature of the self is incorporated in Karma Yoga, as it involves the contemplation of the self as being a non-agent. It is also in line with the nature of life (Prakrti). Karma Yoga, is for these reasons easier and it is free from danger of downfall. Therefore, you must perform Karma Yoga only. This is the purport of the verse. If it is contended that any action such as earning money implies 'I-ness', 'My-ness' etc., and will therefore be disturbing to the senses, and that such a person devoted often to works will be in bondage through subtle impressions of his acts, Sri Krsna says:"

Na., 11.3), it is justifiable to take the term Prajapati in its wider connotation and interpret it to mean Narayana who is the Lord of all beings, the creator of the universe and the Self of the universe. In the beginning, i.e., during the creation, He, the Lord of beings, saw all beings helpless by their conjunction with beginningless non-conscient matter, bereft of the distinctions of name and form, and submerged in Himself. They were incapable of attaining the major ends of human existence, being almost one with non-conscient matter. He, the supremely compassionate, with a desire to resuscitate them, created them together with sacrifice in order that they might perform sacrifices as His worship and said: 'By this sacrifice, shall you prosper,' i.e., multiply and prosper. May this sacrifice fulfil your supreme object of desire called release (Moksa) and also the other desires that are in conformity with it. How, then, should this be done?"

The 'Brahman' arises from the imperishable self. Here the term, 'imperishable', indicates the individual self. The physical body, which is inhabited by the self who is satisfied by food and drink, is fit for action; hence the physical body which constitutes the instrument of activity is said to be from the imperishable.

Therefore, the gist of the topic under discussion is that action must be undertaken by one who is alified (for action) but is unenlightened. In the verses beginning from, '(A person does not attain freedom from action by adstaining from action' (4) and ending with, 'You perform the obligatory duties৷৷.And, through inaction, even the maintenance of your body will not be possible' (8), it has been proved that before one attains fitness for steadfastness in the knowledge of the Self, it is the bounden duty of a person who is alified for action, but is not enlightened, to undertake Karma-yoga for that purpose. And then, also in the verses commencing from '(This man becomes bound) by actions other than that action meant for God' (9) and ending with 'O Partha, he lives in vain,' many reasons [Such as, that it pleases God, secures the affection of the gods, and so on.] have been incidentally stated as to why a competent person has to undertake actions; and the evils arising from their non-performance have also been emphatically declared. Such being the conclusion, the estion arises whether the wheel thus set in motion should be followed by all, or only by one who is ignorant of the Self and has not attained to the steadfastness which is fit to be practised by the Sankhyas, the knowers of the Self, through the Yoga of Knowledge only, and which is acired by one ignorant of the Self through the means of the practice of Karma-yoga mentioned above? Either anticipating Arjuna's estion to this effect, or in order to make the meaning of the scripture (Gita) clearly understood, the Lord, revealing out of His own accord that the following substance of the Upanisads-Becoming freed from false knowledge by knowing this very Self, the Brahmanas renounce what is a compulsory duty for those having false knoweldge, viz, desire for sons, etc., and then lead a mendicant life just for the purpose of maintaining the body; they have no duty to perform other than steadfastness in the knowledge of the Self (cf. Br. 3.5.1)-has been presented here in the Gita, says:"

In this manner there is a seence which revolves like a wheel through the mutual relations of cause and effect. Hence, He who is engaged in spiritual practice - whether one is alified for Karma Yoga or Jnana Yoga - if he does not follow, i.e., does not keep in motion the wheel which revolves in a circle through mutual relation of cause and effect - that person by not maintaining his bodily subsistence by means of the 'remainder of sacrifice,' lives in sin. His life begins in sin or develops in sin, or is of both these kinds; he lives the life of sin. Thus he is a reveller in his senses and not in his self. The senses become the pleasure-gardens of one whose mind and body are not nourished by the 'remainders of sacrifices.' Rajas and Tamas preponderate in his body. Being thus turned away from the vision of the self, he rejoices only in the enjoyment of the senses. Therefore, even if he were to attempt for the vision of the self, it will be fruitless. So he lives in vain, O Arjuna. Sri Krsna now says that there is no need for the performance of the 'great sacrifices' etc., according to his station and stage of life, only in respect of a liberated person whose vision of the self does not depend on any external means."

Because of their incomplete knowledge of the self, they are not alified for Jnana Yoga which is of the nature of practising knowledge of the self. They are alified for Karma Yoga only. As they should practise Karma Yoga for the vision of the self in the same manner Karma Yoga should be practised by one who is recognised as virtuous, who is unattached to work by reason of the vision of the self, and who wishes that his conduct should give guidance to others in virtuous conduct. In this way he should protect the world from chaos by his example. Such a person, even though alified for Jnana Yoga, should practice Karma Yoga."

They are therefore attached to the actions of the Gunas - i.e., only to actions forming part of Karma Yoga. They are alified only for Karma Yoga. One who knows the complete truth should not, by himself remaining a practitioner of Jnana Yoga, unsettle those persons who are ignorant and who do not know the complete truth. Those, the ignorant, who tend to follow the behaviour of a great man, when they see him transcend Karma Yoga, will have their minds shaken from Karma Yoga. Thus, the great man, should himself remain established in Karma Yoga, while having the full knowledge of the true nature of the self and contemplating on the self as not being the agent. Thus he should demonstrate that Karma Yoga by itself is an autonomous means for the vision of the self. He should create in those who do not know the complete truth the love of Karma Yoga. The superiority of this Karma Yoga over Jnana Yoga even for those who are alified for Jnana Yoga has already been stated. Therefore one who is a respected person of note should follow this Karma Yoga alone for the good of the world. The method of performing actions after attributing agency to the Gunas by discerning the nature of the self as different from Prakrti, has been taught. The agency of the self is not produced by the inherent nature of the self, but by its contact with the Gunas. Hence by discriminating between what is obtained by contact and not obtained when there is no contact, it has to be understood that this agency is due to the Gunas or Prakrti. Now it is said that the agency of works, first attributed to Gunas, ultimately go to the Supreme Person who is the Self of all. It is done by discerning that the nature of the individual self is one of subservience to the Supreme Person, as they constitute His body:"

Surrender all acts to Me, the Lord of all, who constitutes the inner pervading Self of all beings. 'Adhyatma-cetas' is that mind which is focussed on the self by knowledge of the essential nature of the self as declared in hundreds of Vedic texts. That this individual self constitutes the body of the Supreme Self and is actuated by Him, is taught by Sruti texts like: 'He who has entered within, is the ruler of all beings and is the Self of all' (Tai. Ar., 3.11), 'Him who has entered inside and is the doer' (Ibid., 3.23), 'He who, dwelling in the self, is within the self, whom the Self does not know, whose body is the self, who controls the self from within - He is your internal ruler and Immortal Self' (Br. U., 3.7.22). Smrti texts also speak in the same manner: 'Him who is the ruler of all' (Manu, 12.122). Sri Krsna will say later on: 'And I am seated in the hearts of all; from Me are memory, knowledge and the faculty of reason' (15.15); 'The Lord, O Arjuna, lives in the heart of everything causing them to spin round and round by His power, as if set on a wheel' (18.61). Hence, dedicate to Me, the Supreme Person, all actions considering them as done by Me, by contemplating on the self as actuated by Me by reason of Its constituting My body. And do every thing, considering the actions as My worship only; becoming free from desire for fruits and therefore free from selfishness as regards actions, engage in acts like war etc., devoid of 'fever', i.e., the excitement caused by passions like anger. Contemplate that the Supreme Person, Lord of all, Principal of all, gets done His own works only for the purpose of getting Himself worshipped with His own instruments, namely, the individual selves which belong to Him and are His agents. Become free from selfish attachment to action. Also be free from the feverish concern originating from such thoughts as 'What will become of me with an ancient, endless accumulation of evil arising from beginningless time?' Perform Karma Yoga with ease, for the Supreme Person Himself, worshipped by acts, will free you from bondage. His Lordship and Principalship over all are settled by Sruti texts like: 'Him who is the supreme and great Lord of lords, Him the Supreme Divinity of divinities' (Sve. U., 6.7), 'The Lord of the Universe' (Tai. Na., 11.3), 'The Supreme Ruler of rulers' (Sve. U., 6.6-7). Isvaratva is the same as Sesitva, which means controllership. Sri Krsna declares that this alone is the essential meaning of the Upanisads:"

Contemplating thus, Karma Yoga alone should be practised by both - those who are competent for Karma Yoga only and those who are competent for Jnana Yoga. The implied superiority of Karma Yoga has the following justifications; it is easy to perform, free from liability to lapse, and independent of anything else; it comprises the knowledge of the self also within its scope. On the other hand Jnana Yoga is difficult to practise, is not free from the liability to lapse, leaves one dependent on actions for the sustenance of the body etc. And for a distinguished perosn, this (i.e., Karma Yoga) is especially what ought to be practised.

Thus, these two, attachment and aversion, bring under their control one who aspires to follow Jnana Yoga, and forcibly engage him in actions appropriate to them, in spite of his having established some sort of control over the senses. Such an aspirant fails to get the experience of the self, and therefore becomes completely lost. So no one practising Jnana Yoga should come under the sway of attachment and aversion, which are ruinous. These two, attachment and aversion, are indeed his unconerable foes that deter him from the practice of Jnana Yoga."

And the birth of Vivasvan was at an earlier time, reckoned as twenty-eight cycles of units of four Yugas each. How can I understand as true that you taught it in the beginning? Now, there is no contradiction here, for it was ite possible that He had taught Vivasvan in a former birth. The memory of what was done in former births is ite natural for great men. This should not be taken to mean that Arjuna does not know the son of Vasudeva, the speaker, as the Lord of all. Because he (Arjuna) says later on: 'You are the Supreme Brahman, the Supreme Light and the Supreme Purifier. All the seers proclaim You as the eternal Divine Purusa, the Primal Lord, unborn and all-pervading. So also proclaim the divine sage Narada, Asita, Devala and Vyasa. You Yourself also are saying this to me' (10.12-13.) Arjuna had heard repeatedly from Bhisma and others during the Rajasuya sacrifice of Yudhisthira, 'Krsna alone is the cause of creation and submergence of all the worlds. This universe, consisting of things both animate and inanimate, was created for the sake of Krsna' (Ma. Bha., 2.38.23) 'The entire universe is subservient to Krsna' is the meaning of 'For the sake of Krnsa'. This apparent contradiction may be explained as follows: Arjuna surely knows the son of Vasudeva as the Bhagavan. Though knowing Him as such, he estions as if he did not know Him. This is his intention. Can the birth of the Lord of all, who is antagonistic to all that is evil and wholly auspicious, omniscient, whose will is always true and whose desires are fulfilled - can the birth of such a Person be of the same nature as that of the gods, men etc., who are subject to Karma? Or can it be false like the illusions of a magical show? Or could it be real? In other words, is the birth of the Supreme Being as the incarnate a real fact or a mere illusory phenomenon produced by a magician's art? If His birth is real, what is the mode of His birth? What is the nature of His body? What is the manner of His birth? What is the nature of this body of His? What is the casue of His birth? To what end is He born? The way in which Sri Krsna answers Arjuna's estion, justifies the construing of his estion in this way."

      "English": "4.6 Without forsaking any of the My special alities, as supreme rulership, birthless, imperishability etc., I am born by My free will. Prakrti means one's own nature. The meaning is that by employment of My own Nature and taking a form of My choice, I incarnate by My own will (Maya). The character of My own Nature becomes evident from the following Srutis: 'Him who is of sun-like colour, beyond darkness (Tamas)' (Sve. U., 3.8), 'Him who abides beyond Rajas (active matter)' (Sama 17.1.4.2); 'This Golden Person who is within the sun' (Cha. U. 1.6.6); 'Within the heart, there is the Person consisting of mind, immortal and golden' (Tai. U. 1.6.1); 'All mortal creatures have come from the self-luminous Person' (Yaj., 32.2); 'Whose form is light, whose will is truth, who is the self of ethereal space, who contains all actions, contains all desires, contains all odours, contains all tastes' (Cha. U., 3.14.2); 'Like a raiment of golden colour' (Br. U., 4.3.6). 'Atma-mayaya' means through the Maya which belongs to Myself. Here the term Maya is identical with knowledge as stated in the lexicon of Yaska: 'Maya is wisdom, knowledge.' Further there is the usage of competent people: 'By Maya, He knows the good and bad of his creatures.' Hence by My own knowledge means 'by My will.' Hence, without abandoning My essential attributes which belong to Me the Lord of all, such as being free of sins, having auspicious attributes etc., and creating My own form similar to the configuration of gods, men etc., I incarnate in the form of gods etc. The Sruti teaches the same thing: 'Being unborn, He is born in various forms' (Tai. A., 3.12.7). The purport is that His birth is ite unlike that of ordinary beings. The dissimilarity consists in that He is born out of His own will unlike ordinary beings whose birth is necessitated by their Karma. Thus constured, there is no contradiction also between what was taught earlier and what is taught later as in the statements: 'Many births of Mine have passed, O Arjuna, and similarly yours also. I know them all' (4.5); 'I incarnate Myself' (4.7); and 'He who thus knows in truth My birth and work' (4.9). [All this elaboration is meant to refute the doctrine of mere apparency of incarnations as taught by the Advaitins. Ramanuja, as stated in his Introduction to the Bhasya, upholds the absolute reality of incarnations.] Sri Krsna now specifies the times of His incarnations."

As to that, the control of the mind and body, austerity, etc. are the duties of the Brahmanas, who are sattvika, i.e. have a predominance of the ality of sattva (purity, goodness, etc.). Courage, valour, etc. are the duties of the Ksatriyas, in whom sattva becomes secondary and rajas (passion, attachment, etc.) preponderates. Agriculture etc. are the duties of the Vaisya, in whom tamas (indolence, ignorance, etc.) is secondary and rajas is predominant. Service is the only duty of the Sudra, in whom rajas is secondary and tamas predominates (see chapters 14, 16,17 and 18). In this way, the four castes have been created by Me through a classification of the gunas and duties. This is the idea. And these four castes do not prevail in the other worlds. Hence the specification, 'in the human world'. 'Well, in that caste, by virtues of Your being he agent of the acts of creation of the four castes,etc. You become subject tothe conseence of those actions? Therefore you are not eternally free and the eternal Lord!' This is being answered: Api, even though; I am kartaram, the agent; tasya, of that act, from the empirical standpoint of maya; still, from the highest standpoint, viddhi, know; mam, Me; to be akartaram, a non-agent; and therefore, also know Me to be avyayam, changeless, not subject to the cycle of births and deaths. 'In reality, however, I am not the agent of those actions of which you think I am the agent.' Because"

      "English": "4.14 These actions of varied nature like creation etc., do not contaminate Me i.e., do not bind Me. For the distinctions of gods, men etc., are not brought about by Me, but by the particular Karmas, good and evil, of created beings. Therefore by the process of discriminating between the acired and the inherent, it will be found that I am not the author of this varied creations etc. The created or embodied selves, who are endowed with bodies and organs at the time of creation in accordance with their own Karmas springing from attachment to fruits etc., experience all enjoyments available in creation. Thus for them (embodied selves) alone there is desire for the results of creation etc., and for the results of their Karmas. There is no desire in Me for it. The Sutrakara says to the same effect: 'No partiality or cruelty on account of there being dependence (on the Karma of souls for inealities' (Br. S., 2.1.34). Bhagavan Parasara also says so: 'He (the Lord) is only the operative cause in the creation of beings. That from which the creative forces spring constitutes the material cause. Leaving aside the material cause, the being that becomes embodied does not reire the help of any other thing whatever. A thing is led into the condition in which it is, O best of ascetics, only by its own potentiality' (V. P., 1.4.51-2). The Supreme Person is only the operative cause with regard to the creation of those to be created, i.e., the selves in the bodies of gods etc. The material cause for the differences into gods etc., is the potentiality in the form of previous Karmas of the selves to be created. Therefore, leaving aside the operative cause, i.e., the Supreme Person, the creator, the embodied beings do not reire anything else for causing difference into conditions of gods etc. For these selves are led to take the forms of gods etc., by the potentiality of their own old Karma with which they are connected. Such is the meaning. He who knows Me thus to be the agent of creation etc., and still a non-agent, i.e., as one who has no desire for the results of the acts of creation etc., - such a person is not tied by previous actions, i.e., he is freed from the old Karmas which obstruct the undertaking of Karma Yoga by causing attachment to results. Such is the purport."

देखता है अर्थात् कर्मका अभाव देखता है तथा अकर्ममें शरीरादिकी चेष्टाके अभावमें जो कर्म देखता है। अर्थात् कर्मका करना और न करना दोनों ही कर्ताके अधीन हैं। तथा आत्मतत्त्वकी प्राप्तिसे पूर्व अज्ञानावस्थामें ही सब क्रियाकारक आदि व्यवहार है ( इसीलिये कर्मका त्याग भी कर्म ही है ) इस प्रकार जो अकर्ममें कर्म देखता है। वह मनुष्योंमें बुद्धिमान् है वह योगी है और वह समस्त कर्मोंको करनेवाला है इस प्रकार कर्ममें अकर्म और अकर्ममें कर्म देखनेवालेकी स्तुति की जाती है। पू0 जो कर्ममें अकर्म देखता है और अकर्ममें कर्म देखता है यह विरुद्ध बात किस भावसे कही जा रही है क्योंकि कर्म तो अकर्म नहीं हो सकता और अकर्म कर्म नहीं हो सकता तब देखनेवाला विरुद्ध कैसे देखे उ0 वास्तवमें जो अकर्म है वही मूढमति लोगोंको कर्मके सदृश भास रहा है और उसी तरह कर्म अकर्मके सदृश भास रहा है उसमें यथार्थ तत्त्व देखनेके लिये भगवान्ने कर्मणि अकर्म यः पश्येत् इत्यादि वाक्य कहे हैं इसलिये ( उनका कहना ) विरुद्ध नहीं है क्योंकि बुद्धिमान् आदि विशेषण भी तभी सम्भव हो सकते हैं। इसके सिवा यथार्थ ज्ञानको ही जाननेयोग्य कहा जा सकता है ( मिथ्या ज्ञानको नहीं )। तथा जिसको जानकर अशुभसे मुक्त हो जायगा। यह भी कहा है सो विपरीत ज्ञानद्वारा ( जन्ममरणरूप ) अशुभसे मुक्ति नहीं हो सकती। सुतरां प्राणियोंने जो कर्म और अकर्मको विपरीतरूपसे समझ रक्खा है उस विपरीत ज्ञानको हटानेके लिये ही भगवान्के कर्मण्यकर्म यः इत्यादि वचन हैं। यहाँ कुण्डेमें बेरोंकी तरह कर्मका आधार अकर्म नहीं है और उसी तरह अकर्मका आधार कर्म भी नहीं है क्योंकि कर्मके अभावका नाम अकर्म है। इसलिये ( यही सिद्ध हुआ कि ) मृगतृष्णामें जलकी भाँति एवं सीपमें चाँदीकी तरह लोगोंने कर्म और अकर्मको विपरीत मान रक्खा है। पू0 कर्मको सब कर्म ही मानते हैं इसमें कभी फेरफार नहीं होता। उ0 यह बात नहीं क्योंकि नाव चलते समय नौकामें बैठे हुए पुरुषको तटके अचल वृक्षोंमें प्रतिकूल गतिदीखती है अर्थात् वे वृक्ष उलटे चलते हुए दीखते हैं और जो ( नक्षत्रादि ) पदार्थ नेत्रोंके पास नहीं होते बहुत दूर होते हैं उन चलते हुए पदार्थोंमें भी गतिका अभाव दीख पड़ता है अर्थात् वे अचल दीखते हैं। इसी तरह यहाँ भी अकर्ममें ( क्रियारहित आत्मामें ) मैं करता हूँ यह कर्मका देखना और ( त्यागरूप ) कर्ममें ( मैं कुछ नहीं करता इस ) अकर्मका देखना ऐसे विपरीत देखना होता है अतः उसका निराकरण करनेके लिये कर्मणि अकर्म यः पश्येत् इत्यादि वचन भगवान् कहते हैं। यद्यपि यह विषय अनेक बार शंकासमाधानोंद्वारा सिद्ध किया जा चुका है तो भी अत्यन्त विपरीत ज्ञानकी भावनासे अत्यन्त मोहित हुए लोग अनेक बार सुने हुए तत्त्वको भी भूलकर मिथ्या प्रसंग लालाकर शंका करने लग जाते हैं इसलिये तथा आत्मतत्त्वको दुर्विज्ञेय समझकर भगवान् पुनःपुनः उत्तर देते हैं। श्रुति स्मृति और न्यायसिद्ध जो आत्मामें कर्मोंका अभाव है वह अव्यक्तोऽयमचिन्त्योऽयम् न जायते म्रियते इत्यादि श्लोकोंसे कहा जा चुका और आगे भी कहा जायगा। उस क्रियारहित आत्मामें अर्थात् अकर्ममें कर्मका देखनारूप जो विपरीत दर्शन है यह लोगोंमें अत्यन्त स्वाभाविकसा हो गया है। क्योंकि कर्म क्या है और अकर्म क्या है इस विषयमें बुद्धिमान् भी मोहित हैं। अर्थात् देहइन्द्रियादिसे होनेवाले कर्मोंका आत्मामें अध्यारोप करके मैं कर्ता हूँ मेरा यह कर्म है मुझे इसका फल भोगना है इस प्रकार ( लोग मानते हैं। ) तथा मैं चुप होकर बैठता हूँ जिससे कि परिश्रमरहित और कर्मरहित होकर सुखी हो जाऊँ इस प्रकार देहइन्द्रियोंके व्यापारकी उपरामताका और उससे होनेवाले सुखीपनका आत्मामें अध्यारोप करके मैं कुछ भी नहीं करता हूँ चुपचाप सुखसे बैठा हूँ इस प्रकार लोग मानते हैं। लोगोंके इस विपरीत ज्ञानको हटानेके लिये कर्मणि अकर्म यः पश्येत् इत्यादि वचन भगवान्ने कहे हैं। यहाँ देहेन्द्रियादिके आश्रयसे होनेवाला कर्म यद्यपि क्रियारूप है तो भी उसका लोगोंने कर्मरहित अविक्रिय आत्मामें अध्यारोप कर रक्खा है क्योंकि शास्त्रज्ञ विद्वान् भी मैं करता हूँ ऐसा मान बैठता है। अतः नदीतीरस्थ वृक्षोंमें भ्रमसे प्रतिकूल गति प्रतीत होनेकी भाँति अज्ञानसे आत्माके नित्य सम्बन्धी माने जाकर जो लोकमें कर्म नामसे प्रसिद्ध हो रहे हैं उन कर्मोंमें वस्तुतः नदीतीरस्थ वृक्षोंमें गतिका अभाव देखनेकी भाँति जो अकर्म देखता है अर्थात् कर्माभाव देखता है तथा कर्मकी भाँति आत्मामें अज्ञानसे आरोपित किये हुए शरीर इन्द्रिय आदिकी उपरामतारूप अकर्ममें अर्थात् क्रियाके त्यागमें भी मैं कुछ न करता हुआ चुपचाप सुखपूर्वक बैठा हूँ इस अहंकारका सम्बन्ध होनेके कारण जो कर्म देखता है यानी उस त्यागको भी जो कर्म समझता है। इस प्रकार जो कर्म और अकर्मके विभागको ( तत्त्वसे ) जाननेवाला है वह मनुष्योंमें बुद्धिमान् पण्डित है वह युक्त योगी है और सम्पूर्ण कर्म करनेवाला भी वही है अर्थात् वह पुण्यपापरूप अशुभसे मुक्त हुआ कृतकृत्य है। कई टीकाकार इस श्लोककी दूसरी तरहसे ही व्याख्या करते हैं। कैसे ईश्वरके लिये किये जानेवाले जो ( पञ्च महायज्ञादि ) नित्यकर्म हैं उनका फल नहीं मिलता इस कारण वे गौणी वृत्तिसे अकर्म कहे जाते हैं ( इसी प्रकार ) उन नित्यकर्मोंके न करनेका नाम अकर्म है वह भी पापरूप फलके देनेवाला होनेके कारण गौणरूपसे ही कर्म कहा जाता है। जैसे कोई गौ ब्यायी हुई होनेपर भी यदि दूधरूप फल नहीं देती तो वह अगौ कह दी जाती है वैसे ही नित्यकर्ममें उसके फलका अभाव होनेके कारण जो अकर्म देखता है और नित्यकर्मका न करनारूप जो अकर्म है उसमें कर्म देखता है क्योंकि वह नरकादि विपरीत फल देनेवाला है। यह व्याख्या ठीक नहीं है क्योंकि इस प्रकार जाननेसे अशुभसे मुक्ति नहीं हो सकती अर्थात् जन्ममरणबन्धन नहीं टूट सकता। अतः यह अर्थ मान लेनेसे भगवान्के कहे हुए ये वचन कि जिसको जानकर तू अशुभसे मुक्त हो जायगा। कट जायँगे। क्योंकि नित्यकर्मोंके अनुष्ठानसे तो शायद अशुभसे छुटकारा हो भी जाय परंतु उन नित्यकर्मोंका फल नहीं होता इस ज्ञानसे तो मोक्ष हो ही नहीं सकता। क्योंकि नित्यकर्मोंका फल नहीं होता यह ज्ञान या नित्यकर्मोंका ज्ञान अशुभसे मुक्त कर देनेवाला है ऐसा शास्त्रोंमें कहीं नहीं कहा और न भगवान्ने ही गीताशास्त्रमें कहीं ऐसा कहा है। इसी युक्तिसे ( उनके बतलाये हुए ) अकर्ममें कर्मदर्शनका भी खण्डन हो जाता है। क्योंकि यहाँ ( गीतामें ) नित्यकर्मोंके अभावरूप अकर्ममें कर्म देखनेको कहीं कर्तव्यरूपसे विधान नहीं किया केवल नित्यकर्मकी कर्तव्यताका विधान है। इसके सिवा नित्यकर्म न करनेसे पाप होता है ऐसा जान लेनेसे ही कोई फल नहीं हो सकता। और यह नित्यकर्मका न करनारूप अकर्म शास्त्रोंमें कोई जाननेयोग्य विषय भी नहीं बताया गया है। तथा इस प्रकार दूसरे टीकाकारोंके माने हुए कर्ममें अकर्म और अकर्ममें कर्मदर्शन रूप इस मिथ्यादर्शनसे अशुभसे मुक्ति बुद्धिमत्ता युक्तता सर्वकर्मकर्तृत्व इत्यादि फल भी सम्भव नहीं और ऐसे मिथ्याज्ञानकी स्तुति भी नहीं बन सकती। जब कि मिथ्याज्ञान स्वयं ही अशुभरूप है तब वह दूसरे अशुभसे किसीको कैसे मुक्त कर सकेगा क्योंकि अन्धकार ( कभी ) अन्धकारका नाशक नहीं हो सकता। पू0 यहाँ जो कर्ममें अकर्म देखना और अकर्ममें कर्म देखना ( उन टीकाकारोंने ) बतलाया है वह मिथ्याज्ञान नहीं है किंतु फलके होने और न होनेके निमित्तसे गौणरूपसे देखना है। उ0 यह कहना भी ठीक नहीं क्योंकि गौणरूपसे कर्मको अकर्म और अकर्मको कर्म जान लेनेसे भी कोई लाभ नहीं सुना गया। इसके सिवा श्रुतिसिद्ध बातको छोड़कर श्रुतिविरुद्ध बातकी कल्पना करनेमें कोई विशेषता भी नहीं दिखलायी देती। ( भगवान्को यदि यही अभीष्ट होता तो वे ) उसी प्रकारके शब्दोंसे भी स्पष्ट कह सकते थे कि नित्यकर्मोंका कोई फल नहीं है और उनके न करनेसे नरकप्राप्ति होती है। फिर इस प्रकार कर्ममें जो अकर्म देखता है इत्यादि दूसरोंको मोहित करनेवाले मायायुक्त वचन कहनेसे क्या प्रयोजन था। इस प्रकार उपर्युक्त अर्थ करनेवालोंका तो स्पष्ट ही यह मानना हुआ कि भगवान्द्वारा कहे हुए वचन संसारको मोहित करनेके लिये हैं। इसके सिवा न तो यह कहना ही उचित है कि यह नित्यकर्मअनुष्ठानरूप विषय मायायुक्त वचनोंसे गुप्त रखनेयोग्य है और न यही कहना ठीक है कि ( यह विषय बड़ा गहन है इसलिये ) बारंबार दूसरेदूसरे शब्दोंद्वारा कहनेसे सुबोध होगा। क्योंकि कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते इस श्लोकमें स्पष्ट कहे हुए अर्थको फिर कहनेकी आवश्यकता नहीं होती। तथा सभी जगह जो बात करनेयोग्य होती है वही प्रशसंनीय और जाननेयोग्य बतलायी जाती है। निरर्थक बातको जाननेयोग्य है ऐसा नहीं कहा जाता। मिथ्याज्ञान या उसके द्वारा स्थापित की हुई आभासमात्र वस्तु जाननेयोग्य नहीं हो सकती। इसके सिवा नित्यकर्मोंके न करनेरूप अभावसे प्रत्यवायरूप भावकी उत्पत्ति भी नहीं हो सकती। क्योंकि नासतो विद्यते भावः इत्यादि भगवान्के वाक्य हैं तथा असत्से सत् कैसे उत्पन्न हो सकता है इत्यादि श्रुतिवाक्य भी पहले दिखलाये जा चुके हैं। इस प्रकार असत्से सत्की उत्पत्तिका निषेध कर दिया जानेपर भी जो असत्से सत्की उत्पत्ति बतलाते हैं उनका तो यह कहना हुआ कि असत् तो सत् होता है और सत् असत् होता है परंतु यह सब प्रमाणोंसे विरुद्ध होनेके कारण अयुक्त है। तथा शास्त्र भी निरर्थक कर्मोंका विधान नहीं कर सकता क्योंकि सभी कर्म ( परिश्रमकी दृष्टिसे ) दुःख रूप हैं और जानबूझकर ( बिना प्रयोजन ) किसीका भी दुःखमें प्रवृत्त होना सम्भव नहीं। तथा उन नित्यकर्मोंको न करनेसे नरकप्राप्ति होती है ऐसा शास्त्रका आशय मान लेनेपर तो यह मानना हुआ कि कर्म करने और न करनेमें दोनों प्रकारसे शास्त्र अनर्थका ही कारण है अतः व्यर्थ है। इसके सिवा नित्यकर्मोंका फल नहीं है ऐसा मानकर फिर उनको मोक्षरूप फलके देनेवाला कहनेसे उन व्याख्याकारोंके मतमें स्वचोविरोध भी होता है। सुतरां कर्मणि अकर्म यः पश्येत् इत्यादि श्लोकका अर्थ जैसा ( गुरुपरम्परासे ) सुना गया है वही ठीक है और हमने भी उसीके अनुसार इस श्लोककी व्याख्या की है।",
      "English": "4.18 Since engagement and non-engagement (in action) depend on an agent, therefore, yah, he who; pasyet, ie. pasyati, finds; akarma, inaction, absence of action; karmani, in action-karma means whatever is done, action in general; in tha action-; and yah, who; finds karma, action; akarmani, in inaction, in the absence of action; sah, he; is buddhiman, a wise one; manusyesu, among men. All dealings involving an act, accessories, etc. exist certainly on the plane of ignorance, [Both engagement and non-engagement presuppose agentship and an act of some kind. This, however, holds good on the plane of ignorance, but not on that of Self-realization.] only so long as one has not attained to the Reality. He is a yogi, yuktah, engaged in yoga; and a krtsna-karma-krt, performer of all actions. One who discriminates between action and actions. One who discriminates between action and inaction is praised thus. Objection: Well, what is meant by this contradictory statement, 'He who finds inaction in action', and 'action in inaction'? For action cannot become inaction, nor inaction action. That being so, how can a witness have (such) an incongruous perception? Vedantin: Is it not that [Ast. reads na in place of nanu.-Tr.] to an ordinary foolsih observer, that which is reality is inaction appears as action, and similarly, action itself as inaction? That being so, in order to show things as they are the Lord says, 'He who finds inaction in action', etc. Therefore there is no incongruity. Besides, the alifications such as 'intelligent' etc. (thus) become logical. And by saying, 'there is something to be known', is implied the perception of things as they are. Moreover, freedom from evil cannot follow from an erroneous perception; whereas it has been said, 'by knowing which you will become free from evil'. Therefore, one account of action and inaction being perceived contrarily by the creatures, the Lord's utterance, 'he who finds inaction in action,' etc. is for dispelling their contrary perception. Not that in the empirical plane inaction has action as its receptacle, like a plum in a bowl! Nor even has action inaction as its receptacle, because inaction is a negation of action. Therefore, action and inaction are actually perceived contrarily by the ordinary persons-like seeing water in a mirage, or silver in nacre. Objection: Is it not that to every one action is action itself? Never is there an exception to this. Vedantin: That is not so, becuase when a boat is moving, motionless trees on the bank appear to move in the opposite direction to a man on the boat; an absence of motion is noticed in distant moving things which are not near one's eyes. Similarly, here also occurs the contrary perceptions, viz seeing action in inaction under the idea, 'I am doing', [Ast. omits 'aham karomi iti, under the idea, \"I am doing\"'.-Tr.] and seeing, inaction in acion,-because of which it is said, 'He who finds inaction in action,' etc. in order to eliminate them. As such, although this answer has been given more than once, still a man becomes repeatedly deluded under the influence of a totally opposite perception. And forgetting the truth that has been heard again and again, he repeatedly raises false issues and estions! And therefore, observing that the subject is difficult to understand, the Lord gives His answer again and again. The absence of action in the Self-well-known from the Vedas, Smrtis and logic, as stated in, '(It is said that) This is unmanifest; This is inconceivable' (2.25), 'Never is this One born, and never does It die' (2.20; Ka. 1.2.18), etc.-has been and will be spoken of. The contrary perception of action in that actionless Self, i.e. in inaction, is very deep-rooted, owing to which 'even the intelligent are confounded as to what is action and what is inaction.' And as a conseence of the superimposition of aciton pertaining to the body etc. on the Self, there arises such ideas as, 'I am an agent; this is my action; its result is to be enjoyed by me.' Similarly, with the idea, 'I shall remain iet, whery I shall be free from exertion, free from activity, and happy', and superimposing on the Self the cessation of activities pertaining to the body and organs and the resulting happiness, a man imagines, 'I shall not do anything; I shall sit ietly and happily.' That being so, the Lord says, 'he who finds inaction in action,' etc. with a view to removing this contrary understanding of man. And here in this world, though action belonging to the body and organs continues to be action, still it is superimposed by everyone on the acitonless, unchanging Self, as a result of which even a learned person things, 'I act.' Therefore, in action (karmani), which is universally considered by all people to be inherent in the Self, like the perception of motion in the (stationary) trees on the bank of a river-(in that action) he who contrariwise finds the fact of inaction, like perceiving absence of motion in those trees-. And, in inaction (akarmani) in the cessation of the activities pertaining to the body and organs and ascribed to the Self in the same way that actions are ascribed-, in that action, he who sees action because of egoism being implicit in the idea, 'I am happily seated ietly, without doing anything'-; he who knows thus the distinction between action and inaction, is wise, is learned among men; he is engaged in yoga, he is a yogi, and a performer of all actions. And he, freed from evil, attains fulfilment. This is the meaning. This verse is interpreted by some in another way. How? (Thus:) 'Since the daily obligatory duties (nityakarmas) certainly have no results when performed as a dedication to God, therefore, in a secondary sense, they are said to be inaction. Again, the non-performance of these (nitya-karmas) is inaction; since this produces an evil result, therefore it is called action, verily in a figurative sense. That being so, he who sees inaction in the daily obligatory duties (nitya-karmas) owing to the obsence of their results-in the same way as a cow that does not yield milk is said to be not a cow, though in reality it is so-so also, in the non-performance of the daily obligatory duties, i.e. in inaction, he who sees action since that yields results such as hell etc৷৷.' This explanation is not logical, because freedom from evil as a result of such knowledge is unreasonable, and the utterance of the Lord in the sentence, '৷৷.by knowing which you will become freed from evil', will be contradicted. How? Even if it be that liberation from evil follows from the performance of nitya-karmas, it cannot, however, follow from the knowledge of the absence of their results. For it has not been enjoined (anywhere) that knowledge of the nityakarmas (themselves), leads to the result of freedom from evil. Nor has this been stated here by the Lord Himself. Hery is refuted the 'seeing of action in inaction' [As explained by others.-Tr.], for (according to the opponent) 'seeing of action in inaction' has not been enjoined here [Here, in the present verse.] as a duty, but (what has been enjoined is) merely that performance of the nityakarmas is obligatory. Moreover, no result can accrue from the knowledge that evil arises from non-performance of nityakramas. Nor even has non-performance of nityakarmas. been enjoined as something that should be known. Besides, such results as freedom from evil, wisdom, engagement in yoga, and being a performer of all actions cannot reasonably follow from a false perception of action as inaction. Nor is this a eulogy of false perception. [The stated results accrue from correct knowledge, not from false perception; and correct knowledge alone is praise-worthy.] Indeed, false perception is itself an abvious form of evil! How can it bring about liberation from another evil? Surely, darkness does not become the remover of darkness! Opponent: Well, the seeing of inaction in action, or the seeing of action in inaction-that is not a false perception. Vadantin: What then? Opponent: It is a figurative statement based on the existence or the non-existence of results. Vedantin: Not so, because there is no such scriptural statement that something results from knowing action as inaction and inaction as action, even in a figurative sense. Besides, nothing particular is gained by rejecting what is heard of (in the scriptures) and imagining something that is not. Further, it was possible (for the Lord) to express in His own words that there is no result from the nityakarmas, and that by their non-performance one would have to go to hell. Under such circumstances, what was the need of the ambiguous statement, 'He who sees inaction in action,' etc., which is misleading to others? This being the case, such an explanation by anyone will be clearly tantamount to imagining that statement of the Lord as meant for deluding people. Moreover, this subject-matter (performance of nityakarmas) is not something to be protected with mystifying words. It is not even logical to say that the subject-matter will become easy for comprehension if it is stated again and again through different words. For, the subject-matter that was stated more clearly in, 'Your right is for action alone' (2.47), does not need any repetition. And everwhere it is said that whatever is good and ought to be practised deserves to be understood; anything purposeloss does not deserve to be known. Besides, neither is false knowledge worth aciring nor is the semblance of an object presented by it worth knowing. Nor even can any evil, which is an entity, arise from the non-performance of nityakarmas, which is a non-entity, for there is the statement, 'Of the unreal there is no being' (2.16), and (in the Upanisad) it has been pointed out, 'How can existence originate from nonexistence?' (Ch. 4.2.2). Since emergence of the existent from the nonexistent has been denied, therefore anyone's assertion that the existent originates from the nonexistent will amount to saying that a non-entity becomes an entity, and an entity becomes a non-entity! And that is not rational because it runs counter to all the means of valid knowledge. Further, the scriptures cannot enjoin fruitless actions, they being naturally painful; and it is illogical that what is painful should be done intentionally. Also, if it is admitted that falling into hell results from their non-performance (i.e. of the nityakarmas), then that too is surely a source of evil. In either case, whether one undertakes them or not, the scriptures will be imagined to be useless. And there will be a contradiction with your own standpoint when, after holding that the nityakarmas are fruitless, you assert that they lead to Liberation. Therefore, the meaning of 'He who finds inaction in action,' etc. is just what stands out literally. And the verse has been explained by us accordingly. The aforesaid perception of 'inaction in action,' etc. is being praised:"

      "English": "4.18 Here by the term 'non-action', the knowledge of the self, which is distinct from action and which forms the subject under consideration, is meant. 'He who sees non-action in action and also action in non-action,' denotes him who can perceive knowledge of the self even while action is being performed and who can also perceive action while engaged in non-action, i.e., knowledge of the self. What is the import of this saying? What is taught here is this: One can perceive, by constant contemplation on the truth about the self, that the action that is being performed in itself is a form of knowledge. One can also perceive that this knowledge is also of the form of Karma because of its being contained in Karma Yoga. Both these (i.e., action in the form of knowledge and knowledge in the form of actions) are accomplished by contemplation on the true nature of the self, even while work is being performed. Thus, he who can see actions as included in contemplation on the reality of the self, is wise, i.e., he knows the full meaning of the Sastras; he is fit among men, i.e., fit to attain release. He alone has fulfilled all actions, i.e., carried out the entire purpose of the Sastras. [The purport is that no contradiction between knowledge and action is felt by one who knows the philosophy of the self]. How is the form of knowledge accomplished through works which are obviously activities that are being performed? Sri Krsna explains:"

(Some translate it as desire, hope.-Tr.)], solicitations, have departed; yata-citta-atma, who has the mind and organs under control-one by whom have been controlled (yatau) both the internal organ (citta) and the external aggregate of body and organs (atma); (and) is tyakta-sarva-parigrahah, [ Parigraha: receiving, accepting, possessions, belongings.-V.S.A] totally without possessions- one by whom have been renounced (tyaktah) all (sarvah) possessions (parigrahah); na apnoti, he does not incur; kilbisam, sin, in the form of evil as also rigtheousness-to one aspiring for Liberation, even righteousness is surely an evil because it brings bondage-; [Here Ast. adds tasmat tabhyam mukto bhavati samsarat mukto bhavati ityarthah, therefore, he becomes free from both of them, i.e. he becomes liberated from transmigration.-Tr.] kurvan, by performing; karma, actions; kevalam, merely; sariram, for the purpose of maintaining the body-without the idea of agenship even with regard to these (actions). Further, in the expression, 'kevalam sariram karma', do the words sariram karma mean 'actions done by the body' or 'actions merely for the purpose of maintaining the body? Again, what does it matter if by (the words) sariram karma is meant 'actions done by the body' or 'actions merely for the purpose of maintaning the body? The answer is: If by sariram karma is meant actions done by the body, then it will amount to a contradiction [Contradiction of the scriptures.] when the Lord says, 'one does not incur sin by doing with his body any action meant for seen or unseen purposes, even though it be prohibited.' Even if the Lord were to say that 'one does not incur sin by doing with his body some scripturally sanctioned action intended to secure a seen or an unseen end', then there arises the contingency of His denying something (some evil) that has not come into being! (Further,) from the specification, sariram karma kurvan (by doing actions with the body), and from the use of the word kevala (only), it will amount to saying that one incurs sin by performing actions, called righteous and unrighteous, which can be accomplished with the mind and speech and which come within the purview of injunction and prohibition. Even there, the statement that one incurs sin by performing enjoined actions through the mind and speech will involve a contradiction; even in the case of doing what is prohibited, it will amount to a mere purposeless restatement of a known fact. On the other hand, when the sense conveyed by sariram karma is taken as acctions merely for the purpose of maintaining the body, then the implication will be that he does not do any other work as can be accomplished physically, orally, or mentally, which are known from injunctions and prohibitions (of the scriptures) and which have in view seen or unseen results; while he appears to people to be working with those very body (speech) etc. merely for the purpose of maintaining the body, yet he does not incur sin by merely making movements of the body etc., because from the use of the word kevala, (merely) it follows that he is devoid of the sense of agentship implicit in the idea, 'I do.' Since there is no possibility of a person who has reached such a state incurring evil as suggest by the word sin, therefore he does not become subject to the evil of transmigration. That is to say, he certainly becomes free without any obstacle since he has all his actions burnt away by the fire of wisdom. This verse is only a reiteration of the result of full illumination stated earlier. It becomes faultless by accepting the interpretation of sariram karma thus. In the case of the monk who has renounced all possessions, since owning food etc. meant for the bare sustenance of the body is absent, therefore it becomes imperative to beg for alms etc. for the upkeep of the body. Under this circumstance, by way of pointing out the means of obtaining food etc. for the maintenance of the body of a monk as permitted by the text, 'What comes unasked for, without forethought and spontaneously৷৷.' [Unasked for: what comes before the monk gets ready for going out for alms; without forethought: alms that are not given with abuses, and have not fallen on the ground, but collected from five or seven houses without any plan; spontaneously: alms brought to one spontaneously by devoted people.] (Bo. Sm. 21. 8. 12) etc., the Lord says:"

करता है उस साधनको ब्रह्मरूप ही देखा करता है अर्थात् आत्माके सिवा उसका अभाव देखता है। जैसे ( सीपको जाननेवाला ) सीपमें चाँदीका अभाव देखता है ब्रह्म ही अर्पण है इस पदसे भी वही बात कही जाती है। अर्थात् जैसे यह समझता है कि जो चाँदीके रूपमें दीख रही है वह सीप ही है। ( वैसे ही ब्रह्मवेत्ता भी समझता है कि जो अर्पण दीखता है वह ब्रह्म ही है ) ब्रह्म और अर्पण यह दोनों पद अलगअलग हैं। अभिप्राय यह कि संसारमें जो अर्पण माने जाते हैं वे स्रुक् स्रुव आदि सब पदार्थ उस ब्रह्मवेत्ताकी दृष्टिमें ब्रह्म ही हैं। वैसे ही जो वस्तु हविरूपसे मानी जाती है वह भी उसकी दृष्टिमें ब्रह्म ही होता है। ब्रह्माग्नौ यह पद समासयुक्त है। इसलिये यह अर्थ हुआ कि ब्रह्मरूप कर्ताद्वारा जिसमें हवन किया जाता है वह अग्नि भी ब्रह्म ही है और वह कर्ता भी ब्रह्म ही है और जो उसके द्वारा हवनरूप क्रिया की जाती है वह भी ब्रह्म ही है। उस ब्रह्मकर्ममें स्थित हुए पुरुषद्वारा प्राप्त करनेयोग्य जो फल है वह भी ब्रह्म ही है। अर्थात् ब्रह्मरूप कर्ममें जिसके चित्तका समाधान हो चुका है उस पुरुषद्वारा प्राप्त किये जानेयोग्य जो फल है वह भी ब्रह्म ही है। इस प्रकार लोकसंग्रह करना चाहनेवाले पुरुषद्वारा किये हुए कर्म भी ब्रह्मबुद्धिसे बाधित होनेके कारण अर्थात् फल उत्पन्न करनेकी शक्तिसे रहित कर दिये जानेके कारण वास्तवमें अकर्म ही हैं। ऐसा अर्थ मान लेनेपर कर्मोंको छोड़ देनेवाले कर्म संन्यासीके ज्ञानको भी यथार्थ ज्ञानकी स्तुतिके लिये यज्ञरूप समझना भली प्रकार बन सकता है अधियज्ञमें जो स्रुवादि वस्तुएँ प्रसिद्ध हैं वे सब इस यथार्थ ज्ञानी संन्यासीके ( सम्यक्ज्ञानरूप ) अध्यात्मयज्ञमें ब्रह्म ही हैं। उपर्युक्त अर्थ नहीं माननेसे वास्तवमें सब ही ब्रह्मरूप होनेके कारण केवल स्रुव आदिको ही विशेषतासे ब्रह्मरूप बतलाना व्यर्थ होगा। सुतरां यह सब कुछ ब्रह्म ही है इस प्रकार समझनेवाले ज्ञानीके लिये वास्तवमें सब कर्मोंका अभाव ही हो जाता है। तथा उसके अन्तःकरणमें ( क्रिया फल आदि ) कारकसम्बन्धी भेदबुद्धिका अभाव होनेके कारण भी यही सिद्ध होता है क्योंकि कोई भी यज्ञ नामक कर्म कारकसम्बन्धी भेदबुद्धिसे रहित नहीं देखा गया। अभिप्राय यह है कि अग्निहोत्रादि सभी कर्म ( इन्द्राय वरुणाय आदि ) शब्दोंद्वारा हवि आदि द्रव्य जिनके अर्पण किये जाते हैं उन देवताविशेषरूप सम्प्रदान आदि कारकबुद्धिवाले तथा कर्तापनके अभिमानसे और फलकी इच्छासे युक्त देखे गये हैं। जिसमेंसे क्रिया कारक और फलसम्बन्धी भेदबुद्धि नष्ट हो गयी हो तथा जो कर्तापनके अभिमानसे और फलकी इच्छासे रहित हो ऐसा यज्ञ नहीं देखा गया। परंतु यह उपर्युक्त कर्म तो ऐसा है कि जिसमें सर्वत्र ब्रह्मबुद्धि हो जानेके कारण अर्पणादि कारक क्रिया और फलसम्बन्धी भेदबुद्धि नष्ट हो गयी है। इसलिये यह अकर्म ही है। यही बात कर्मण्यकर्म यः पश्येत् कर्मण्यभिप्रवृत्तोऽपि नैव किंचित्करोति सः गुणा गुणेषु वर्तन्ते नैव किंचित्करोमीति युक्तो मन्येत तत्त्ववित् इत्यादि श्लोकोंद्वारा भी दिखलायी गयी है। और इसी प्रकार दिखलाते हुए भगवान् जगहजगह क्रिया कारक और फलसम्बन्धी भेदबुद्धिका निषेध कर रहे हैं। देखा भी गया है कि सकाम अग्निहोत्रादिमें कामना न रहनेपर वे सकाम अग्निहोत्रादि नहीं रहते। ( उनकी सकामता नष्ट हो जाती है। ) तथा यह भी देखा गया है कि जानबूझकर किये हुए और अनजानमें किये हुए कर्म भिन्नभिन्न कार्योंके आरम्भक होते हैं अर्थात् उनका फल अलगअलग होता है। वैसे ही यहाँ भी जिस पुरुषकी सर्वत्र ब्रह्मबुद्धि हो जानेसे ( स्रुव हवि आदिमें ) क्रिया कारक और फलसम्बन्धी भेदबुद्धि नष्ट हो गयी है उस ज्ञानी पुरुषके बाह्य चेष्टामात्रसे होनेवाले कर्म भी अकर्म हो जाते हैं। इसलिये कहा है कि उसके फलसहित कर्म विलीन हो जाते हैं। इस विषयमें कोईकोई टीकाकार कहते हैं कि जो ब्रह्म है वही स्रुव आदि है अर्थात् ब्रह्म ही स्रुव आदि पाँच प्रकारके कारकोंके रूपमें स्थित है और वही कर्म किया करता है ( उनके सिद्धान्तानुसार ) उपर्युक्त यज्ञमें स्रुव आदि बुद्धि निवृत्त नहीं की जाती किंतु स्रुव आदिमें ब्रह्मबुद्धि स्थापित की जाती है जैसे कि मूर्ति आदिमें विष्णु आदि देवबुद्धि या नाम आदिमें ब्रह्मबुद्धि की जाती है। ठीक है यदि यह प्रकरण ज्ञानयज्ञकी स्तुतिके लिये न होता तो यह अर्थ भी हो सकता था। परंतु इस प्रकरणमें तो यज्ञ नामसे कहे जानेवाले अलगअलग बहुतसे क्रियाभेदोंको कहकर फिर द्रव्यमय यज्ञकी अपेक्षा ज्ञानयज्ञ कल्याणकर है इस कथनद्वारा ज्ञानयज्ञ शब्दसे कथित सम्यक् दर्शनकी स्तुति करते हैं। तथा इस प्रकरणमें जो ब्रह्मार्पणम् इत्यादि वचन है यह ज्ञानको यज्ञरूपसे सम्पादन करनेमें समर्थ भी है नहीं तो वास्तवमें सब कुछ ब्रह्मरूप होनेके कारण केवल अर्पण ( स्रुव ) आदिको ही अलग करके ब्रह्मरूपसे विधान करना व्यर्थ होगा। जो ऐसा कहते हैं कि यहाँ मूर्तिमें विष्णु आदिकी दृष्टिके सदृश या नामादिमें ब्रह्मबुद्धिकी भाँति अर्पण ( स्रुव ) आदि यज्ञकी सामग्रीमें ब्रह्मबुद्धि स्थापन करायी गयी है उनकी दृष्टिसे सम्भवतः इस प्रकरणमें ब्रह्मविद्या नहीं कही गयी है क्योंकि ( उनके मतानुसार ) ज्ञानका विषय स्रुव आदि यज्ञकी सामग्री ही है ब्रह्म नहीं। इस प्रकार केवल ब्रह्मदृष्टि सम्पादनरूप ज्ञानसे मोक्षरूप फल नहीं मिल सकता और यहाँ ( स्पष्ट ही ) यह कहा है कि उसके द्वारा प्राप्त किया जानेवाला फल ब्रह्म ही है फिर बिना यथार्थ ज्ञानके मोक्षरूप फल मिलता है यह कहना सर्वथा विपरीत है। इसके सिवा ( ऐसा मान लेनेसे ) प्रकरणमें भी विरोध आता है। अभिप्राय यह है कि जो कर्ममें अकर्म देखता है इस प्रकार यहाँ आरम्भमें सम्यक् ज्ञानका ही प्रकरण है तथा उसीमें उपसंहार होनेके कारण अन्तमें भी यथार्थ ज्ञानका ही प्रकरण है। क्योंकि द्रव्यमय यज्ञकी अपेक्षा ज्ञानयज्ञ श्रेष्ठतर है ज्ञानको पाकर परम शान्तिको तुरंत ही प्राप्त हो जाता है इत्यादि वचनोंसे यथार्थ ज्ञानकी स्तुति करते हुए ही यह अध्याय समाप्त हुआ है। फिर बिना प्रकरण अकस्मात् मूर्तिमें विष्णुदृष्टिकी भाँति स्रुव आदिमें ब्रह्मदृष्टिका विधान बतलाना उपयुक्त नहीं। सुतरां जिस प्रकार इसकी व्याख्या की गयी है इस श्लोकका अर्थ वैसा ही है।",

He perceives it as not existing separately from the Self, as one sees the non-existence of silver in nacre. In this sense it is that Brahman Itself is the ladle-just as what appears as silver is only narcre. (The two words brahma and arpanam are not parts of a compound word, samasa.) The meaning is that, to a knower of Brahman, what is perceived in the world as ladle is Brahman Itself. Similarly, brahma-havih, the oblations is Brahman: To him, what is seen as oblations is nothing but Brahman. In the same way, brahma-agnau, (-this is a compound word-) in the fire of Brahman: The fire into which oblation is hutam, poured; brahmana, by Brahman, by the agent, is Brahman Itself. The meaning is that Brahman Itself is the agent (of the offering). That he makes the offering-the act of offering-, that is also Brahman. And the result that is gantavyam, to be reached by him; that also is brahma eva, surely Brahman. Brahma-karma-samadhina, by him who has concentration on Brahman as the objective: Brahman Itself is the objective (karma); he who has concentration (samadhi) on That is brahma-karma-samdhih. The goal to be reached by him is Brahman alone. Thus, even the action undertaken by one who desires to prevent mankind from going astray is in reality inaction, for it has been sublated by the realization of Brahman. This being so, in the case of the monk from whom aciton has dropped off, who has renounced all activity, viewing his Knowledge as a (kind of) sacrifice, too, becomes all the more justifiable from the point of view of praising full realization. That is, whatever is well known as ladle etc. in the context of a sacrifice, all that, in the context of the Self, is Brahman Itself to one who has realized the supreme Truth. If not so, then, since all in Brahman, it would have been uselesss to specifically mention ladle etc. as Brahman. Therefore, all actions cease to exist for the man of realization who knows that Brahman Itself is all this. And this follows also from the absence (in him) of the idea of accessories. [See note on p.211.-Tr.] For the act called 'sacarifice' is not seen to exist without being in association with the idea of accessories. All such acts as Agnihotra etc. are associated with the ideas of such accessories as making an offering etc. to the particular gods who are revealed in the scriptures, and with the idea of agentship as also desire for results. But they are not found bereft of the ideas of such distinctions as exist among action, accessories and results, or unassociated with the ideas of agentship hankering for results. This (apparent) (activity of the man of Knowledge), however, stands dissociated from the ideas of differences among the accessories like ladle etc., actions and results, which get destroyed by the Knowledge of Brahman. Hence, it is inaction to be sure. And thus has it been shown in, 'He who finds inaction in action' (18), 'he really does not do anything even though engaged in action' (20), 'the organs act on the objects of the organs' (3.28), 'Remaining absorbed in the Self, the knower of Reality should think, \"I certainly do not do anything\"' (5.8), etc. While pointing out thus, the Lord demolishes in various places the ideas of differences among actions, accessories and results. And it is also seen in the case of rites such as Agnihotra undertaken for results (kamya), that the Agnihotra etc. cease to be (kamya) rites undertaken for selfish motives when the desire for their results is destroyed. Similarly, it is seen that actions done intentionally and unintentionally yeild different results. So, here as well, in the case of one who has his ideas of distinctions among accessories like ladle etc., actions and results eliminated by the knowledge of Brahman, even activites which are merely external movements amount to inaction. Hence it was said, 'gets totally destroyed.' Here some say: That which is Brahman is the ladle etc. It is surely Brahman Itself which exists in the five forms [Asscessories that can be indicated by the five grammatical case-ending, viz Nominative, Objective, Instrumental, Dative and Locative. (As for instance, the sacrificer, oblation, ladle, sacrificial fire, and Brahman.-Tr.) of accessories such as the ladle etc. and it is Itself which undertakes actions. There the ideas of ladle etc. are not eradicated, but the idea of Brahman is attributed to the ladle etc. as one does the ideas of Visnu etc. to images etc., or as one does the idea of Brahman ot name etc. Reply: True, this could have been so as well if the context were not meant for the praise of jnanayajna (Knowledge considered as a sacrifice). Here, however, after presenting full realization as expressed by the word jnana-yajna, and the varieties of rites as referred to by the word yajna (sacrifice), Knowledge has been praised by the Lord in, 'Jnana-yajna (Knowledge considered as a sacrifice) is greater than sacrifices reiring materials' (33). And in the present context, this statement, 'the ladle is Brahman' etc., is capable of presenting Knowledge as a sacrifice; otherwise, since Brahman is everything, it will be purposeless to speak specially only of ladle etc. as Brahman. But those who maintain that one has to superimpose the idea of Brahman on the ladle etc., like superimposing the idea of Visnu and others on images etc. and of Brahman on name etc., for them the knowledge of Brahma stated (in the verse) cannot be the intended subject-matter dealt with here, because according to them ladle etc. are the (primary) objects of knowledge (in the context of the present verse). Besides, knowledge in the form of superimposition of an idea cannot lead to Liberation as its result; and what is said here is, 'Brahman alone in to be realized by him'. Also, it is inconsistent to maintain that the result of Liberation can be achieved without full realization. And it goes against the context-the context being of full realization. This is supported by the fact that (the subject of ) full realization is introduced in the verse, 'He who finds inaction in action,' and at the end (of this chapter) the conclusion pertains to that very subject-matter. The chapter comes to a close by eulozing full realization itself in, 'Jnana-yajna (Knowledge considered as a sacrifice) is greater than sacrifices reiring materials', 'Achieving Knowledge, one৷৷.attains supreme Peace,' (39) etc. That being so, it is unjustifiable to suddenly say out of context that one has to superimpose the idea of Brahman on the ladle etc. like the superimposition of the idea of Visnu on images. Therefore this verse bears the meaing just as it has been already explained. As to that, after having presented Knowledge as a sacrifice, other sacrifices also are being mentioned now in, the verses beginning with, '(Other yogis undertake) sacrifice to gods alone,' etc., for eulogizing that Knowledge:"

      "English": "4.24 The expression 'Brahman is the instrument to offer with' (It is to be remembered that in Ramanuja's system 'Brahman' in the primary sense is the 'Whole' with the Supreme Being as the Soul and Atmans and Matter (Prakrti) as His body in inseparable union with the Whole. So the word 'Brahman' can, according to the needs of each context, be used to indicate the Supreme Being, the Atman, or Prakrti; In verse 24 it has been used in all these senses. We have therefore put it in italics. See Introduction.) is adjectival to 'the oblation'. That by which an offering is given, such as a ladle, is an Arpana. It is called Brahman because it is an effect of Brahman, Brahman being the material cause of the universe. 'Brahmaarpanam' is the oblation, of which the instrument is Brahman. The oblation, just like the instrument with which it is offered, is also Brahman. It is offered by the agent Brahman into the fire of Brahman. He is the Brahma-karma-samadhi who contemplates thus on all acts as filled with the Supreme Brahman or as having the Supreme Brahman as the Self. He who contemplates on Brahman as the Soul of all actions, reaches Brahman alone, as his own self has the Supreme Brahman as Its Self. The meaning is that the individual self - which is Brahman because of Its having Brahman as Its Self - has to realise Its own real nature. All actions performed by an aspirant for release have the form of knowledge because of their association with the contemplation of the Supreme Brahman as their self. They are a direct means for the vision of the self without the meditation of Jnana Yoga. Thus, Sri Krsna, after explaining how Karma takes the form of knowledge, now speaks of the various kinds of Karma Yoga."

Kumbhaka (stoppage of breath) is that when the flow of both inward and outward breaths is stopped. The clause, restricting of diet, applies to all the three types of persons devoted to the control of breath. All these, according to their liking and capacity are engaged in performing the various kinds of Karma Yoga beginning from the sacrifice of material objects to the control of breath. They know and are devoted to sacrifices comprising obligatory and occasional rituals preceded by the performance of 'the great sacrifices' (Panca-Maha-Yajna), as alluded to in 'Creating men along with the sacrifices' (3.10). Because of this only, their sins are done away with. Those who are engaged in Karma Yoga by sustaining their bodies only by the ambrosia of sacrificial remains will go to the eternal Brahman.

Hence, Knowledge reduces to ashes only all those actions that were done (in this life) prior to the rise of Knowledge and that have not become effective, as also those performed along with (i.e. after the dawn of) Knowledge, and those that were done in the many past lives. Since this is so, therefore,"

The independence of Jnana Yoga and Karma Yoga from each other as means for attainment of the self is now declared."

Therefore his senses are subdued. His self is said to have become the self of all beings. Because of his being devoted to contemplation on the true nature of the self, he finds that his self is similar to the self of all beings like gods etc. One who contemplates on the true nature of the self understands that all selves are of the same form or nature. The distinctions obtaining among gods, men etc., cannot pertain to the form of the self, because those distinctions are founded on particular modifications of Prakrti i.e., the bodies of beings. Sri Krsna will teach: 'For the Brahman (an individual self), when untainted, is the same everywhere' (5.19). The meaning of this is that when dissociated from the Prakriti, i.e., the body, the self is of the same nature everywhere, i.e., in the bodies of gods, men etc. It is of the same form of knowledge. The meaning is that one, who has become enlightened in this way, active though he be, is not tainted on account of erroneously conceiving what is other than the self (the body) as the self. He is not at all associated therewith. Therefore, he attains the self without any delay.

Just as a lotus leaf is not wetted by water, actions do not affect or defile a person with sin, if he is free from such identification with the body."

      "English": "5.13 Aste, he continues; sukham, happily; sannyasya, having given up; sarva-karmani, all actions-nitya, naimittika, kamya and nisiddha (prohibited actions); [See note on p. 128.-Tr.] manasa, mentally, through discriminating wisdom-i.e. having given up (all actions) by seeing inaction in action, etc. Freed from the activities of speech, mind and body, effortles, placid in mind, and devoid of all external wants which are different from the Self, he continues happily. This is what has been said. Where and how does the vasi, man of self-control, i.e. one who has his organs under control, remain? This is being answered: Nava-dvare pure, in the town with nine gates, of which seven [Two ears, two eyes nostrils, and mouth.] are in the head for one's own experiences, and two are below for urination and defecation. As possessed of those gates, it is called the 'town with nine gates'. Being like a town, the body is called a town with the Self as its only master. And it is inhabited by the organs, mind, intellect and objects, like citizens, as it were, which serve its needs and which are productive of many results and experience. Renouncing all actions, the dehi, embodied one, resides in that town with nine gates. Objection: What is the need of this specification? For all embodied beings, be they monks or not, reside in bodies to be sure! That being so, the specification is needless. The answer is: The embodied one, however, who is unenlightened, who perceives merely the aggregate of the body and organs as the Self, he, in his totality, thinks, 'I am in a house, on the ground, or on the seat.' For one who experiences the body alone as the Self, there can certainly be no such conviction as, 'I am in the body, like one's being in a house.' But, for one who realizes the Self as distinct from the aggregate of body etc. it becomes reasonable to have the conviction, 'I am in the bdoy. It is reasonable that as a result of knowledge in the form of discriminating wisdom, there can be a mental renunciation of the actions of others, which have been ignorantly superimposed on the supreme Self. Even in the case of one in whom has arisen discriminating wisdom and who has renounced all actions, there can be, like staying in a house, the continuance in the body itself-the town with nine gates-as a conseence of the persistence of the remnants of the results of past actions which have started bearing fruit, because the awareness of being distinct (from the body) arises while one is in the body itself. Form the point of veiw of the difference between the convictions of the enlightened and the unenlightened persons, the alifying words, 'He continues in the body itself', do have a purpose to serve. Although it has been stated that one continues (in the body) by relinishing actions of the body and organs ignorantly superimposed on the Self, still there may be the apprehesion that direct or indirect agentship inheres in the Self. Anticipating this, the Lord says: na eva kurvan, without himself doing anything at all; and na karayan, not causing (others) to do, (not) inducing the body and organs to activity. Objection: Is it that the direct or indirect agentship of the embodied one inheres in the Self and ceases to be after renunciation, as the movement of a traveller ceases with the stoppage of his movement? Or, is it that they do not exist owing to the very nature of the Self? As to this, the answer is: The Self by Its nature has neither direct nor indirect agentship. For it was stated, 'It is said that৷৷.This (Self) is unchangeable' (2.25). 'O son of Kunti, although existing in the body, It does not act, nor is It affected' (13.31). And it is also stated in the Upanisad, 'It seems to meditate, as it were; It seems to move, as it were' (Br. 4.3.7)."

For this reason It does not take away or remove the evil or suffering of anyone such as a son who is related and therefore dear to one; nor does It take away, i.e., remove the happiness of anyone whom It deems with aversion. All this is the effect of Vasanas or subtle impressions of Prakrti. How does do these contrary Vasanas originte in the case of one whose intrinsic nature is a described above? In answer it is said that knowledge is enveloped by the darkness of ignorance. The Atman's knowledge is enveloped, i.e., contracted by preceding Karmas which are opposed to knowledge, so that a person may be alified to experience the fruits of his own Karma. It is by this Karma, which contracts knowledge, and can join the Jiva with the bodies of gods etc., that the misconception that the bodies are the selves is produced. Conseently there will originate the Vasanas or the unconscious subtle impressions born of such misapprehension of the self and the inclination to undertake actions corresponding to them. Sri Krsna now brings into proper seence what has been taught before in the following verses: 'You will completely cross over the sea of all your sins with the boat of knowledge' (4.36), and 'The fire of knowledge reduces all Karmas to ashes in the same way' (4.37), and 'For there is no purifier here eal to knowledge' (4.38)."

      "English": "5.16 While all these selves are thus deluded, in the case of enlightened souls, their delusive ignorance - which envelops knowledge and which is of the form of accumulated, beginningless and endless Karma - is destroyed by knowledge. As already described this knowledge is produced by the teachings of the scriptures about the real nature of the self, which are enriched by daily practice. The purity of this knowledge is unexcelled. And in the case of those selves who regain the knowledge that is natural to Them, it is found that it is unlimited and uncontracted and illumining everything like the sun. Plurality of the selves in Their essence is expressly mentioned in the case of those whose ignorance is overcome, in the expression 'for those' in the text. What was stated at the commencement, 'There never was a time when I did not exist' (2.12) is expressed here with greater clarity. Moreover, this plurality is not due to limiting adjuncts imposed on a single universal self. For, as stated here, there cannot be any trace of such adjuncts for those whose ignorance is destroyed, and still They are described as a plurality. Hence knowledge is taught as an attribute inseparable from the essential nature of the self, because a difference between the self and its knowledge is made out in the statement, 'Knowledge, in their case illuminates like the sun'. By the illustration of the sun, the relation of the knower to his knowledge is brought out to be similar to the luminous object and its luminosity. Therefore, it is appropriate to understand that knowledge contracts by Karma in the stage of Samsara and expands in the stage of Moksa (release). [In this system the Atman has two forms of Jnana or Knowledge - Dharmi-Jnana (self-awareness) and Dharma-bhuta-Jnana (awareness of objects other than itself). It is the latter that is contracted by ignorance and expands by knowledge. See Intrdocution.]  English Translation Of Sri Sankaracharya's Sanskrit Commentary By Swami Gambirananda 5.16 Tu, but; yesam, in the case of those creatures; of whom tat ajnanam, that ignorance; atmanah, of theirs-being covered by which ignorance creatures get deluded-; nasitam, becomes destroyed; jnanena, by knowledge, by discriminating knowledge concerning the Self; tesam, their; jnanam, knowledge; adityavat, like the sun; prakasayati, reveals, in the same way as the sun reveals all forms whatever; tat-param, that supreme Reality, the Reality which is the highest Goal, the totality of whatever is to be known."

He who craves for the results of actions becomes dependent on the results of actions. But this person is the opposite of such a one. Hence (it is said), 'wihtout depending on the result of action. Having become so, yah he who; karoti, performs accomplishes; (karma, an action;) which is his karyam, duty, the nityakarmas such as Agnihotra etc. which are opposed to the kamya-karmas-. Whoever is a man of action of this kind is distinguished from the other men of action. In order to express this idea the Lord says, sah, he ; is a sannyasi, monk, and a yogi.

Objection: Is it not only with regard to one who does not keep a fire and is acitonless that monasticsm and meditativeness are well known in the Vedas, Smrtis and scriptures dealing with meditation? Why are monasticism and meditativeness spoken of here with regard to one who keeps a fire and is a man of action-which is not accepted as a fact? Reply: This defect does not arise, because both are sought to be asserted in some secondary sense. Objection: How is that? Reply: His being monk is by virtue of his having given up hankering for the results of actions; and his being a man of meditation is from the fact of his doing actions as accesories to meditation or from his rejection of thoughts for the results of actions which cause disturbances in the mind. Thus both are used in a figurative sense. On the contrary, it is not that monasticism and meditativeness are meant in the primary sense. With a veiw to pointing out this idea, the Lord says:"

Accepting what kind of similarity between Karma-yoga, which is characterized by engagement (in actions), and its opposite, renunciation in the real sense, which is characterized by cessation from work, has their eation been stated? When such an apprehension arises, the answer is this; From the point of view of the agent, there does exist a simialrity of Karma-yoga with real renunciation. For he who is a monk in the real sense, from the very fact of his having given up all the means needed for accomplishing actions, gives up the thought of all actions and their results-the source of desire that leads to engagement in work. [Thoughts about an object lead to the desire for it, which in turn leads to actions for getting it. (Also see note under 4.19)] also, even while performing actions, gives up the thought for results. Pointing out this idea, the Lord says: Hi, for; kascit, nobody, no man of action whosoever; asannyasta-sankalpah, who has not given up expactaions-one by whom has not been renounced expectation, anticipation, of results;bhavati, becomes, i.e. can become; yogi, a yogi, a man of concentration, because thought of results is the cause of the disturbance of mind. Therefore, any man of action who gives up the thought of results would become a yogi, a man of concentration with an unperturbed mind, because of his having given up thought of results which is the cause of mental distractions. This is the purport. Thus, because of the similarity of real monasticism with Karma-yoga from the point of veiw of giving up by the agent, Karma-yoga is extolled as monasticism in, 'That which they call monasticism, know that to be Yoga, O Pandava.' Since Karma-yoga, which is independent of results, is the remote help to Dhyana-yoga, therefore it has been praised as monasticism. Thereafter, now the Lord shows how Karma-yoga is helpful to Dhyana-yoga:"

From the expression, 'one who has given up thought about eveything', it follows that one has to renounce all desires and all actions, for all desires have thoughts as their source. This accords with such Smrti texts as: 'Verily, desire has thought as its source. Sacrifices arise from thoughts' (Ma. Sm. 2.3); 'O Desire, I know your source. You surely spring from thought. I shall not think of you. So you will not arise in me' (Mbh. Sa. 177.25). And when one gives up all desires, renunciation of all actions becomes accomplished. This agrees with such Upanisadic texts as, '(This self is identified with desire alone.) What it desires, it resolves; what it resolves, it works out' (Br. 4.4.5); and also such Smrti texts as, 'Whatever actions a man does, all that is the effect of desire itself' (Ma. Sm. 2.4). It accords with reason also. For, when all thoughts are renounced, no one can even move a little. So, by the expression, 'one who has given up thought about everything', the Lord makes one renounced all desires and all actions.

Its addiction to sense objects is the cause of his bondage; its separation from sense objects is the means of one's release' (V. P., 6.7.28). The proper condition for the beginning of Yoga is now taught:"

In, 'Making the mind fixed in the Self' (25), the Lord will speak of concentrating the mind verily on the Self.

That is being stated: As sukham, happiness, is dear to me, so also is happiness agreeable to all creatures. Va, and-the word va is (used) in the sense of and; just as yadi, whatever; duhkham, sorrow is unfavourable, unwelcome to me, so also is sorrow unwelcome and unfavourable to all creatures. In this way, he looks upon happiness and sorrow as pleasant and unpleasant to all bengs, by the same standard as he would apply to himself. He does not act against anyone. That is , he is non-injurious. He who is thus non-injurious and steadfast in full Illumination, sah, that yogi; paramah matah, is considered as the best among all the yogis. Noticing that his Yoga-as spoken of and consisting in full Illumination- is hard to acire, Arjuna, with a view to hearing the sure means to its attainment, said:"

In the verses beginning with, 'He sees the self as abiding in all beings' (6.29), Yogins at four degrees of attainment have been mentioned. Since the Yogin who is now mentioned in this passage cannot be included in the four types mentioned earlier, the genitive case specifying one out of many will be inappropriate here. In 'api sarvesam,' those who practise austerities etc., are referred to by the word 'sarva' (all). According to the principle set forth, here also the case ending has to be taken as ablative. The meaning therefore is that the Yogin who is now referred to, is the most integrated compared with those mentioned earlier and all other types. Compared to this Yogin, the differences in point of superiority and inferiority among the other Yogins such as the performers of austerities etc., are of no significance like mustard-seeds compared to Mount Meru. Even though there exists smallness and bigness in relation to one another among mustard-seeds, still when compared to Meru, such distinctions among them have no significance, as they are all small compared to Meru. I consider him the most integrated who, with his innermost self, has his mind fixed on Me, on account of My being the only object of his overflowing love and also on account of his having a nature which cannot be supported by anything other than Myself; who has 'faith,' i.e., who strives rapidly to attain Me because of his being unable to bear a moment's separation from Me on account of My being very dear to him; and who 'worships Me,' i.e., serves Me with devotion and meditates on Me - Me whose sportive delight brings about the origination, sustentation and dissolution of the entire cosmos filled with multifarious and innumerable objects of enjoyment, enjoyers, means and places of enjoyment; who is untouched by any evil without exception; whose divine figure is the treasue-house of innumerable multitudes of auspicious, unlimited and unsurpassed attributes such as knowledge, power, lordship, energy, potency and splendour; whose divine figure is the treasure-house of infinite, unsurpassed attributes agreeable and highly worthy, such as radiance, beauty, fragrance, tenderness, pervading sweetness and youthfulness which are uniform, inconceivable and divine, wondrous, eternal and flawless; whose essential nature and alities transcend all thought and words; who is the great ocean of compassion, condescension, paternal love and beauty; who is the impartial refuge of all beings without exception and without considerations of any difference; who is the reliever of the distress of supplicants; who is the great, unfathomable ocean of affection for supplicants; who has become visible to the eyes of all men without abandoning His essential nature; who has incarnated in the house of Vasudeva; who has made the entire would illumined with His limitless and excellent glory; and who has satisfied the entire universe with the impeccable glory of beauty.

This controllership over inanimate nature is exercised through the animate Prakrti (the Jivas) who form the inner controller (Sesin) of their bodies which are constituted of inanimate nature. 2) I am supreme to all in another sense also - as the possessor of knowledge, power, strength etc., in an infinite degree. There is no entity other than Me with such attributes of an eal or superior nature. The aggregate of all the animate and inanimate things, whether in their causal state or in the state of effect, is strung on Me who abides as their Self, as a row of gems on a thread. They depend on Me. And it is proved that the universe of inanimate and animate beings exists as the body with Brahman (i.e. the Supreme Person) as their Self as declared by the Antaryami-brahmana and other texts: 'He whose body is the earth' (Br. U., 3.7-3), 'He whose body is the self' (Br. U. Madh., 3.7.22), and 'He is the inner self of all beings, without evil, He is the Lord in the supreme heaven, He is the one Narayana' (Su. U., 7). Thus, as everything constitutes the body of the Supreme Person forming only a mode of His who is their Self, the Supreme Person alone exists, and all things (which we speak of as diversity) are only His modes. Therefore all terms used in common parlance for different things, denote Him only. Sri Krsna shows this by coordinating some important ones among these entities with Himself."

Because it is created by Me, the Divine, for purpose of sport, it is divine in its power and therefore difficult to overcome. The word Maya is used for the effects of the three Gunas, because it has got the power of generating wonderful effects as in the case of the magic of Asuras and Raksasas. See the passages: 'Then the excellent discus, the flaming Sudarsana, was despatched by the Lord to defend the boy. The thousand Mayas or wonderfully created weapons of the evil-designed Sambara were foiled one after another, by that ickly moving discus, for protecting the body of the boy' (V. P., 1.19. 19-20). Here the term Maya does not signify the sense of 'false'. Even with regard to magicians, when the term, Mayavin (one who possesses Maya) is used, there is origination of real impressions with the aid of certain incantations, herbs etc., though the objects created are illusory things. Accordingly the term Maya denotes the incantations, herbs etc., which have got the power of creating real impressions. Inasmuch as the sense of the term should be invariable, following the usage in all cases, the term Maya can be applied to the illusory objects, only in a secondary sense, while its primary sense in regard to the real impressions generated in the mind. It is just like in the statement 'The cots cry.' The Maya of the Lord, which is absolutely real and which consists of the Gunas, is alone taught in the texts like, 'Know then Maya to be the Prakrti and the possessor of the Maya to be the great Lord' (Sve. U., 4.10). It not only obscures the essential nature of the Lord but also creates the condition of the mind that sees its objects as enjoyable. Therefore, the entire universe, deluded by the Lord's Maya, does not know the Lord who is of the nature of boundless beatitude. (On the other hand they feel objects set forth by Maya as enjoyable). Sri Krsna teaches the way of deliverance from Maya: (b) But those who take refuge in Me alone - Me whose resolves are always true, who has supreme compassion, and who is the refuge of all beings without exception and without consideration of their particular status - such persons shall pass beyond this Maya of Mine consisting of the three Gunas. The meaning is that they worship Me alone, renouncing the Maya. Why, then do all not take recourse to refuge in the Lord which is conducive to the worship of the Lord?"

For, those who receive from Me anything, however small they are, I consider them as contributing everything to Me (and thus as benefactors). But I deem the man of knowledge to be My very self. I consider Myself as depending on him for My support. Why is it so? Because this person considers Me to be the highest and finds it impossible to support himself without Me; I also find it impossible to be without him. Thus, verily, he is My self. The attainment of this state of mind reires innumerable auspicious births. It is attained after gaining the knowledge of the real nature of the self and the self feels that Its happiness consists in being a dependant (Sesa) of Myself."

      "English": "7.19 Further after passing through innumerable auspicious births, one gets the knowledge: 'I find my sole joy as a Sesa of Vasudeva. I find my essence, existence and activities to be dependent on Him. He is superior over all others on account of His innumerable auspicious attributes.' Conseent to this knowledge he resorts to Me, i.e., meditates on Me, realising, 'Vasudeva alone is my highest end and also the means for attaining it, and whatever other desire remains in the mind, He alone is all that too for me'. Such a great-souled person, i.e., great-minded man is hard to find. It is very hard to find such persons in this world. This is the only meaning of the statement that 'Vasudeva is all,' because of the topic having been begun with the statements: 'For I am very dear to the man of knowledge' (7.17) and 'For he, integrated, is devoted to Me alone as the highest end' (7.18). It is so, also because that Jnanin whose traits are given here, possesses the same alities as the man of knowledge described earlier. For, it has been said that the two Prakrtis, the animate and the inanimate, have their sole essence in being the Sesa (dependants) of the Supreme Person in the verses beginning with 'Earth, water' (7.4) and ending with, 'Ego-sense, thus My Prakrti is divided eightfold. This is my lower (Prakrti). But know that which is other than this (lower nature) and forms the life-principle to be the higher Prakrti' (7.4-5). Then take the beginning from 'I am the origin and dissolution of the whole universe. There is nothing higher than Myself, O Arjuna' (7.6-7), and ending with, 'Know that all the states of Sattva, Rajas and Tamas are from Me alone. But I am not in them. They are in Me' (7.12). It has been declared in these texts that the two Prakrtis, both in their states of cause and effect, depend upon Him for their essence, existence and activities and that the Supreme Person is superior to everything in all respects. Therefore the knower of this truth alone is here spoken of as a man of knowledge or as one knowing 'All this is Vasudeva.' [The purpose of this explanation is to eliminate any pure monistic slant to this passage.] Sri Krsna now explains the rarity of finding such a person of knowledge.

(Creatures are duluded) by that. By what? When that is thus sought to be known in particular, the Lord answers: dvandva-mohena, by the delusion of duality. Delusion (moha) that originates from duality (advandva) is dvandva-moha. Those very likes and dislikes, which are mutually opposed like heat and cold, which relate to happiness and sorrow and their causes, and which come into association with all beings in due course, are termed as duality (and this deludes all creatures). As regards them, when likes and dislikes arise from the experience of happiness, sorrow and their causes, then, by bringing the wisdom of all beings under their control, they create bewilderment which is the cause of the impediment to the rise of knowledg about the reality of Self, the suprem Truth. Indeed, exact knowledg about objects even in the external world does not arise in one whose mind is overpowered by the defects, viz likes and dislikes. It goes without saying that knowledge of the indwelling Self, beset with many obstacles as it is, does not arise in a completely bewildered person whose intelligence has been overcome by them. Therefore, bharata, O scion of the Bharata dynasty; owing to that delusion of duality arising from likes and dislikes, sarvabhutani, all creatures become deluded. Parantapa, O destroyer of foes; they yanti sammoham, become bewildered, come under delusion; sarge, at the time of their birth, i.e. at the time of their origination. The idea is that all creatures that come into being do so prepossessed by delusion. 'Since this is so, therefore all creatures, being deluded and having their wisdom obstructed by that delusion of duality, do not know Me who am their Self. Hence, they do not adore Me as their Self.' 'Who, again, are those that, becoming free from the delusion of duality, come to know You, and adore You as the Self in accordance with the scriptures?' In order to elaborate the subject enired about, it is being said:"

      "English": "7.27 As soon as beings are born they are deluded. This delusion springs from sense experiences described as pairs of opposites like heat and cold. Such reactions spring from desire and hate. The purport is this: Desire and hatred for the pairs of opposites like pleasure and pain, which are constituted of Gunas, have their origin in the Jivas from the past experiences they had in their previous births. The subtle impressions or Vasanas of these previous experiences manifest again as instinctive desire and hatred towards similar objects in every succeeding birth of the Jivas. The delusive force of these impressions make them deluded from the very beginning. It becomes their nature to have love or hatred for such objects, in place of having happiness and misery at union with or separation from Me. The Jnanin, however, feels happiness when he is in union with Me and misery when separated from Me. No other being is born with such a nature as found in the Jnanin."

The Srutis say to this effect: 'The Avyakta is dissolved into the Aksara, the Aksara is dissolved into Tamas' (Su. U., 2). The supreme Aksara is the essential form of the self, separated from Prakrti. One's own material nature (the body) is spoken of as Adhyatma or that which dwells with the self. This material nature (Svabhava) is Prakrti. It does not form the self but attaches itself to the self in the form of subtle elements, impressions etc. This has been taught in the Vidya of Five Fires (Cha. U., 5). Both these (the Aksara and the Adhyatma) should be known by the aspirants for liberation (Kaivalya) - the former as what should be attained and the latter as what should be relinished. Karma is that force which produces the origination of mundane beings. 'Beings' here means beings such as the human beings. The creative force which produces their origination is contact with woman. It has been described in the Sruti passage thus: 'The waters sacrificed in the fifth oblations become those who are named Purusas' (Cha. U., 5.3.3). That creative force is called Karma. All the acts associated with that should be considered by aspirants after release as calling for abstention. This abstention will also be inculcated immediately in the text, 'Desiring which they practise the vow of continence' (8.11)."

Ksarah is that which is mutable, which is destructible; bhavah means anything whatsoever that has orgination. This is meaning. Purusah means the Person, derived in the sense of he by whom all things are pervaded; or, he who lies in every heart. He is Hiranyagarbha, who resides in the Sun and sustains the organs of all creatures. He is adhi-daivatam, the entity existing in the divine plane. Deha-bhrtam-vara, O best among the embodied beings; adhiyajnah, the entity existing in sacrifices, is the Deity, called Visnu, presiding over all sacrifices-which agrees with the Vedic text, 'Sacrifice is indeed Vishu' (Tai, Sam. 1.7.4). Aham eva, I Myself, who am that very Visnu; am adhiyajnah, the entity existing in the sacrifice; which is going on atra dehe, in this body. Since a sacrfice is performed with body, therefore it is closely associated with the body. In this sense it is said to be going on in the body."

      "English": "8.4 The perishable existences which have been declared as fit to be known by the seekers of wealth, power etc., form the Adhibhuta. They are superior material entities that remain in ether or space and other elements. They are the evolutes of material elements and are perishable in their nature. They are also of the nature of sound, touch etc., supported by their basic subtle elements but different from, and finer than, ordinary sound etc., and are of many kinds. Sound, touch, form, taste and smell on this kind, which are manifold and rooted in their several bases, are to be gained by the seekers after prosperity and should be contemplated upon by them. Adhidaivata connotes Purusa. The Purusa is superior to divinities like Indra, Prajapati and others, and is the experiencer of sound etc., which are different from, and superior to, the multitude of enjoyments of Indra, Prajapati etc. The condition of being such an enjoyer is to be contemplated upon by the seekers after prosperity, as the end to be attained. I alone am connoted by the term Adhiyajna (sacrifice). Adhiyajna denotes one who is propitiated in sacrifices. Indra and others, to whom sacrifices are made, form My body. I dwell as their Self and I alone am the object of worship by sacrifice. In this manner the three groups of alified devotees should contemplate at the time of the practice of periodical and occasional rituals like the great sacrificies. This is also common to all the three groups of devotees."

U., 2). The process of involution ends, after passing through all the other stages of dissolution, with the Avyakta, Akasa and Tamas. Therefore, for every other entity except Myself, origination and annihilation are unavoidable. So for those who seek Aisvarya (prosperity and power) birth and dissolution according to the above mentioned time arrangement are unavoidable. But in the case of those who attain to Me, there is no return again to Samsara. [The immense duration of time, according to ancient thinkers, is as follows: Catur-yuga, or a unit of the four yugas of Krta, Treta, Dvapara and Kali, has a cumulative duration of 4,320,000 human years. A thousand such periods constitute a day time of Brahma and a similar period his night. Periodic creation and dissolution of the universe take place in these two periods respectively. One year of Brahma consists of 360 such diurnal period. A Brahma has a life-span of 100 such years - i.e., 311, 040, 000,000,000 human years. At the end of it, there is a Mahapralaya, and a new Brahma comes into being. Time thus goes on endlessly]. Now Sri Krsna teaches that there is no return to Samsara even for those who have attained Kaivalya (isolation of the self)."

      "English": "8.22 That Supreme Person has been declared in such texts as 'There is nothing higher than Myself, O Arjuna. All this is strung on Me, as rows of gems are on a thread' (7.7), and 'Who am beyond them and immutable' (7.13) - He is the Supreme Person in whom all beings abide and by whom all this is pervaded. He is to be attained by undivided devotion as described in 'Whose mind is not in anything else' (8.14). Now, Sri Krsna teaches the 'path of light,' described in the Srutis which is common to the knowers of the true nature of the self and to the persons who are devoted to the Supreme Person. The nature of this path is alified as one of 'non-return to Samsara.' In the case of a person journeying through the 'path of light,' as described in the text of the worship of Five Fires is as follows: 'So those who know It (i.e., the eternal nature of the individual self) thus, as taught in the Vidya of the Five Fires, and those too who worhip in the forest with faith and Tapas go to the deity ruling over the rays of light, and from there to the deity of the day' (Cha. U., 5.10.1). The attainment of the Supreme Brahman and the non-return to birth are declared with reference to those who go by the path of light, etc., by the teaching that 'He the Supreme Being leads them to Brahman ৷৷. Those who reach by this path do not return to the (wordly) life of man' (Cha. U., 4.15.5). This declaration of the goal in the text, 'Those who know it thus etc.,' is not with reference to the attainment of the Atman which constitutes ony the limb of the science of Brahman as taught in the beginning of Prajapati's teaching. For there will then arise purposelessness for the separate teaching of the same in regard to the principal science of the Supreme in the text. 'Those who are in the forest worship by means of faith and austerity etc.,' (Cha. U., 5.10.1). It is taught in the Vidya (meditation) of Five Fires: 'Thus, indeed, in the fifth oblation the waters become Purusa' (Cha. U., 5.9.1) and 'Those with a balance of good Karmas ৷৷. and those with a balance of bad Karmas' (Ibid., 5.10.7). What is to be understood here is that the state of existence as men and other beings, which has its origin in good and evil Karmas, refer to the 'waters' which alone are mixed with other elements (i.e., to the body-mind); as for the self, there is only contact with them and not identification. Thus, is declared the difference between intelligent self and inanimate matter. Then, by the texts, 'Those who know this' (Ibid., 5.10.1), 'Those who go to the rays of light' (Ibid.), and 'They who proceed by it return not to the human condition here,' it is instructed that those who know this concerning the sentient and inanimate entities - the one to be attained and the other to be rejected , they jourey along the path described by the terms 'beginning with light and do not return to Samsara'. On account of the passage, 'He leads them to the Brahman' (Ibid., 4.15.5), which holds that the Brahman is attained by both the knower of real nature of the self and the devotees of the Supreme Person and also because of the axiom of 'results according to efforts' (Tat-kratu-nyaya), the entity self, separated from the inanimate matter, should be constantly meditated upon as having its sole joy in absolute subservience to the Supreme Brahman who is Its self. The self's nature of finding only joy consists in absolute subservience to the Surpeme Person. This is proved from the Srutis like 'He who dwells within the self ৷৷. whose body is the self' (Sa. Bra., 14.6.5.5.30)."

Or fire and light are the well-known Vedic deities. As the expression 'mango grove' is used with regard to a place where mango trees are more numerous, similarly, the expressions 'at which time' and 'that time' (in the earlier verse) are used in view of the predominance (of the deities presiding over time). [If the first two (fire and light) are taken as Vedic deities, then the remaining three are the only deities of time. Still, the latter being numerically greater, all the five deities are referred to as deities of time. The deities of both the Paths-of gods and manes, or of the Northern and the Southern Paths as they are called-who are gods of time, are referred to here as 'time' by such words as day, fortnight, six months, etc.] So also, ahah, daytime, means the deity of daytime. Suklah, the bright fortnight, implies the deity presiding over the bright fortnight. Sanmasah uttarayanam, the six months of the Northern solstice-here, too, is understood the deity presiding over the Path. This is the principle (of interpretation followed elsewhere (in the Upanisads also). Tatra, following this Path; janah, persons; who are brahma-vidah, knowers of Brahman, those engaged in meditation on (the alified) Brahman; gacchanti, attain; brahma, Brahman; prayatah, when they die. It is understood that they attain Brahman through stages. Indeed, according to the Upanisadic text, 'His vital forces do not depart' (Br. 4.4.46), there is neither going nor coming back for those established in full realization, who are fit for immediate Liberation. Having their organs merged in Brahman, they are suffused with Brahman, they are verily identified with Brahman."

Thus there is the Vedic text, 'The one divine Being is hidden in all beings; He is amnipresent, the indwelling Self of all bengs, the Supervisor of actions, the refuge of all beings, the witness, the one who imparts consceiousness, unconditioned [This is according to Sankaracarya's commentary on this verse. A.G. interprets kevala as non-dual.-Tr.] and without alities' (Sv. 6.11). Anena hetuna, owing to this reason-because of this presiding over; O son of Kunti, the jagat, world, with the moving and the non-moving things, consisting of the manifest and the unmanifest; viparivartate, revolves, under all conditions [During creation, continuance and dissolution.] All the activities of the world in the form, 'I eat this; I see; I hear this; I experience this happiness, suffer this sorrow; I shall do this for that purpose, [Ast. omits this portion.-Tr] I shall do this for this purpose; I shall know this,' etc. indeed arise owing to their being the objects of the conscious witness. They verily exist in consciousness, and end in consciousness. And such mantras as, 'He who is the witness of this is in the supreme heaven' [Supreme heaven, the heart; i.e. He is inscrutable.] (Rg., Na. Su. 10.129.7; Tai. Br.2.8.9), reveal this fact. Since it follows from this that there is no other conscious being part from the one Deity-who is the witness of all as the absolute Consciousness, and who in reality has no contact with any kind of enjoyment-, therefore there is no other enjoyer. Hence, in this context, the estion, 'For what purpose is this creation?', and its answer are baseless-in accordance with the Vedic text, 'Who know (It) truly, who can fully speak about this here? From where has this come? From where is this variegated creation?' (Rg. 3.54.5; 10.129.6). And it has been pointed out by the Lord also: 'Knowledge remains covered by ignorance. Thery the creatures become deluded' (5.15)."

An example is 'Wherein (i.e., in the Supreme Self) the sacrifices known as the Caturhotri attain their fulfilment through the divinities' (Tai. Ar., 4) etc. These texts say in what way these forms of worship apply to these divinties. For all Vedanta texts lay down that the Supreme Person alone is to be worshipped directly when they enjoin the worship of Indra and other divinities, as they form the body of the Supreme Person. The meaning is that in the Caturhotri sacrifice like Agnihotra, the full moon and the new moon sacrifices etc., it is the Supreme Self only that is worshipped, as He abides as the self in Indra etc., who are the ostensible objects worshipped in these sacrifices by which these worshippers obtain their fulfilment through them. Therefore, the votaries of the three Vedas do not understand that these rituals form the worship of the Supreme Person and that He alone is to be worshipped.

Those who intend to worship gods, like Indra and others with the resolution, 'Let us worship Indra and other gods by ceremonies like the new moon and full moon sacrifices' - such worshippers go to Indra and other gods. Those who intend worshipping manes, resolving 'Let us worship the manes through sacrifices,' - such worshippers go to the manes or others resolving - 'Let us worship the Yaksas, Raksasas,' Pisacas and other evil spirits' - they go to them. But those who, with the same rites of worship, worship Me with the intention, 'Let us worship Lord Vasudeva, the Supreme Self, whose body is constituted of gods, the manes and the evil spirits' - they are My worshippers and they reach Me only. Those who intend worshipping gods etc., attain gods etc. After sharing limited enjoyment with them, they are destroyed with them when the time comes for their destruction. But My worshippers attain Me, who has no beginning or end, who is omniscient, whose will is unfailingly effective, who is a great ocean of innumerable auspicious attributes of unlimited excellence and whose bliss too is of limitless excellence. They do not return to Samsara. Such is the meaning. Sri Krsna continues to say, 'There is also another distinguishing characteristic of My worshippers.'"

Such an offering coming from a heart rendered pure with that singleness of purpose of considering the offering as an end in itself - I, the Lord of the universe, whose sport consists in the origin, maintenance and dissolution of the entire world, who has all desires fulfilled, whose will is always accomplished, whose auspicious attributes are unlimited and unsurpassed, who is enjoying the infinite and unsurpassed bliss that is in Myself - I accept and enjoy the aforesaid type of offering, as if I was obtaining a desired object far beyond the range of My hopes. Thus it is declared in the Moksa-dharma: \"Whatever acts are consecrated by those whose intellects are concentrated in single-pointed devotion, all these, the Lord Himself accepts on His head.\" (Ma. Bha. Sa., 340.64) Sri Krsna proceeds to say: As there is this distinctive excellence, incomprehensible by speech and mind in respect of these great men called the Jnanins, you also, following them, become a Jnanin, i.e., have your self and all your belongings 'bent down,' i.e., dedicated, under the weight of Bhakti as prescribed earlier. Be always singing My praises, doing My services, worshipping Me and prostrating before Me; also perform your secular and Vedic duties, periodical and occasional, in this manner.'"

      "English": "9.34 Focus your mind on Me; fix your mind on Me uninterruptedly like a continous stream of oil - on Me the Ruler of rulers, antagonistic to all that is evil, the sole abode of auspiciousness, omniscient, whose resolve is always true, the sole cause of the entire universe, the Supreme Brahman, the Supreme Person; on Me, of long large eyes like a lotus petal; who has the complexion of a clear blue cloud; whose shining lustre is like that of a thousand suns simultaneously risen; on Me, the great ocean of the nectar of beauty; of four arms, noble and strong, and of brilliant yellow raiment; on Me, adorned with a pure crown, fish-shaped ear-rings, garlands, bracelet on the arms and bangles at the wrist; on Me, the ocean of infinite mercy, affability, beauty, sweetness, majesty, magnanimity and parental affection; on Me, the refuge of all without exception and without regard to their differences; on Me the Lord of all. Sri Krsna again makes the same clear. Be My devotee. Be one whose mind is focussed on Me by contemplating on Me as exceedingly dear. Such is the meaning. He makes thie yet clearer. Be My worshipper, namely, become engaged in My worship, which you have begun to practise by your experience of Me as supremely dear and unlimited and unsurpassed. What is called worship is the conduct of one who realises that he is absolutely a subsidiary - (Sesa) of God. Worship consists also in offering all things of enjoyment such as waving of lights etc., all those things which come into bodily contact like garlands, sandal paste etc., and those meant for offering like food preparations and other edibles. The meaning is this: Let your mind be focussed on Me so as to be engaged in My worship, resulting from love which is unlimited and unsurpassed and which is born from the experience of Myself. Again Sri Krsna expounds the same: Bow down to Me. Do not be satisfied only with services of one who is absolutely subsidiary to me. Do services which are incomparably dear and animated by an experience of Myself who is dear and unlimited and unsurpassed. Also bow down to Me in utter humility, regarding Me as the supreme goal, i.e., He who is the supreme abode and the supreme goal. The meaning is that having resorted to Me, it is impossible for you to live without Me. Having disciplined the mind in this way and considering Me as the supreme goal, you will thus, through love which is unsurpassed and incomparable, obtain a mind which is fit for experiencing Me. You will then reach Me alone. Here the term Atman stands for the mind. The import is that, holding Me as the sole support, possesing a mind of this kind, meditating on Me, experiencing Me, worshipping Me and bowing down to Me - you will reach Me alone. Thus, with such a turn of mind you carry on, for pleasing Me alone, your secular works for bodily sustenance and Vedic activities like obligatory and occasional rites, regarding them as actuated by Me and finding sole joy in absolute subservience to Me. You shall ever engage yourself in praising My names with love and in endeavouring to serve Me and bowing down to Me etc. You shall contemplate on the entire universe as being under My rule and being subsidiary (Sesa) to Me. Contemplating on the multitudes of My attributes, which are exceedingly dear to you, and practising every day this worship as described, you will reach Me alone.  English Translation Of Sri Shankaracharya's Sanskrit Commentary By Swami Gambirananda 9.34 Manmana bhava, have your mind fixed on Me; [Here Ast. adds the word vasudeva.-Tr] and also be madbhakah, devoted to Me. Madyaji, sacrifice to Me, be engaged in sacrificing to Me. And namaskuru, bow down; only mam, to Me. Yuktva, by concentrating your mind; and mat-parayanah, by accepting Me as the supreme Goal; esyasi eva, you shall surely attain; mam, Me who am God. You shall attain Me evam atmanam, who am thus the Self: I indeed am the Self of all the beings, and am also the supreme Goal. You shall attain Me who am such. In this way, the word atmanam (Self) is to be connected with the preceding word mam (Me). This is the purport."
